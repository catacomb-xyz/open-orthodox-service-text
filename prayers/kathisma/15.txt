Troparion, tone 1

How great is the abyss of my sins, Savior, / and I went to the bottom miserably from my sins! / Give me your hand, like Peter, / and save me, O God, / and have mercy on me.

Glory: For evil thoughts and deeds / I am worthy of condemnation, Savior, / but grant me the thought of conversion, O God, so that I cry out: / Save me, Good Benefactor, / and have mercy on me!

And now: Blessed and Immaculate Maiden in God! / Me, bad and impure / from obscene deeds and bad thoughts, / cleanse me, unfortunate, / Spotless and Pure, / All-holy Mother-Virgo.

Lord have mercy (40) and prayer:

In the Lord Jesus Christ, You are my helper, I am in Your hands; help me, do not let me sin before You, for I have lost my way. Do not leave me to follow the will of my flesh, do not despise me, Lord, for I am weak.
You know what is good for me, do not leave me to perish from my sins, do not leave me, Lord, do not depart from me, for I have resorted to You, teach me to do Your will, for You are my God. Heal my soul, for I have sinned against You. Save me by
Thy mercy, for before Thee are all who oppress me, and there is no other refuge for me but Thee, O Lord. Let all be put to shame who rise up against me and seek my soul in order to destroy it! For You, O Lord, are One among all Mighty, and Your glory is in
ages of ages. Amen.
