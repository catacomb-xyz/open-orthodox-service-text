Troparion, tone 8

You are the fullness of all blessings, my Christ, / fill my soul with joy and gladness / and save me, the One Most Merciful.

Glory: Although I have sinned, / Christ, my Savior, before You, / I do not know any other God but You, / but I boldly trust in Your mercy. / Turning, accept me, Merciful Father, / and the Only Begotten Son, and the Holy Spirit, / as a prodigal
son, and save me.

And now: I don’t know any other refuge and hot Defender, / besides You. / As having boldness to the One Born of You, Mistress, / help and save me, Your servant.

Lord have mercy (40) and prayer:

Lord Jesus Christ, my God, have mercy on me, a sinner, and forgive me, Your unworthy servant, everything in which I have sinned against You during the whole time of my life and even to this day; and if, as a person, I have sinned in something,
my voluntary and involuntary sins, committed by deed and word, mind and thought, from enthusiasm and inattention, and my much laziness and neglect. If he swore by Your name, if he swore falsely, or accepted blasphemous thoughts, or whom he reproached, or
slandered, or saddened, or angered in some way, or stole, or fell into fornication, or lied, or secretly ate, or a friend came to me, and I neglected him, or insulted and grieved my brother, or, when I stood at prayer and psalmody, my vicious mind
I thought of evil, or enjoyed it beyond measure, or laughed madly, or spoke blasphemous things, or was vain, or was proud, or I saw vain beauty and was seduced by it, or an obscene thing came into my head, if in some way I
did not care about my prayer, or I didn’t keep the commandments of my spiritual father, or I idled, or did something else evil - for I did all this and more than this, which I don’t even remember. Have mercy, Lord, and forgive me everything, so that I can fall asleep and rest in peace, singing,
and blessing, and glorifying You, with Your Beginningless Father and with Your Most Holy, and Good, and Life-giving Your Spirit, now, and always, and forever centuries. Amen.
