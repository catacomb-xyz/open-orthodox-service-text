Troparion, tone 3

Living on earth, my soul, repent: / the dust in the grave cannot sing, / and then you will not get rid of your sins. / Call to Christ God: / “Seer of the heart, I have sinned, / before my condemnation, have mercy on me!”

How long, my soul, are you in sin? / How long do you put off the time of repentance? / Imagine the coming Judgment in your mind and cry to the Lord: / “Seer of the heart, I have sinned, / before my condemnation, have mercy on me!”

Glory: At the Last Judgment without accusers I am convicted, / without witnesses I am condemned, / for the books of conscience are revealed / and secret deeds are revealed. / Before you test what I have done at that national spectacle / God,
cleanse me and save me.

And now: It is incomprehensible and incomprehensible, / Lady favored by God, / the terrible sacrament accomplished in You: / for having conceived the Immeasurable, You gave birth to Him, / clothed in flesh from Your pure blood. / Pray Him, Pure as Your Son,
/ save all those who sing to You.

Lord have mercy (40) and prayer:

Lord Almighty, the Word of the Father without beginning, the perfect God Himself, Jesus Christ, by the mercy of Your unparalleled mercy, never leaves Your servants, but always dwells in them! Do not leave me, Thy servant, O
All-Holy King, but grant me, unworthy, the joy of Thy salvation and enlighten my mind with the light of the knowledge of Thy Gospel, bind my soul with love to Thy Cross, decorate my body with Thy dispassion, grant peace to my thoughts, and feet save mine
from stumbling. And do not destroy me with my iniquities, good Lord, but try me, O God, and enlighten my heart, search me and know my paths, and see if there is a way of iniquity in me, and turn away from it, and guide me to the path
eternal. For You are the way, and the truth, and the life, and we send glory to You with Your Father without beginning, and the Most Holy, and the Good, and the Life-giving Spirit, now, and always, and forever and ever. Amen.
