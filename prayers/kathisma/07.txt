Troparion, tone 5

With the Judge sitting and the angels standing by, / a sounding trumpet, a burning flame / what will you do, my soul, / when they bring you to the Judgment? / For then your evil deeds will be revealed, / and secret sins will be revealed. / Therefore,
before the end, call on the Judge: / “God, cleanse me and save me!”

Glory: Let us all be awake and meet Christ / with a lot of oil and lamps of light, / in order to be worthy to enter into the chamber; / for the one left behind the doors will call out to God in vain: / “Have mercy on me!”

And now: Lying on the bed of many sins, / I lose hope of my salvation, / for the dream of my laziness portends torment to my soul. / But Thou, O God, born of a Virgin, / raise me up to sing to Thee, / that I may praise Thee.

Lord have mercy (40) and prayer:

Lord , my God, You, as Good and Lover of mankind, have done many mercies with me, which I did not hope to see! And what shall I repay Your goodness, my Lord, Lord? I thank Your unceasingly chanted name, I thank
Your inscrutable mercy towards me, I thank Your unparalleled long-suffering. And from now on, protect me, and help me, and cover me, Lord, from all troubles, so that I no longer sin before You. For You know the inclination of my nature
to fall, You know my folly, You know what I have done, consciously and unknowingly, voluntarily and involuntarily, night and day, and in my mind and in thought. Cleanse, as a Good and Human-loving God, all this with the dew of Your mercy, Most Good Lord,
and save us for the sake of Your holy name, in Your known ways. For You are the light, and the truth, and the life, and we give glory to You, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and always and forever and ever. Amen.
