Troparion, tone 5

I, having slipped into the depths of sin, / are overwhelmed by the anxiety of despair, / but soon appear, Christ, as the Almighty, the Ruler of all, / and direct me to the quiet harbor of dispassion, / by mercy, Savior, / and
save me.

Glory: Soul, you are here temporarily, but you will be there forever. / I see the place of Judgment and the Judge on the throne / and I tremble, waiting for the verdict. / Turn at last, soul: / court without condescension!

And now: The hope of those who have lost hope, / the help of the helpless, / the protection of those who trust in You, / Holy Lady Theotokos, / send Your help to us.

Lord have mercy (40) and prayer:

Lord, generous and merciful, long-suffering and many-merciful, hear the prayer and heed the voice of my prayer! Create on me a sign for good, guide me on Your path, so that I can walk in Your truth, rejoice
my heart so that I will revere Your holy name, for You are great and work wonders, You, the One God, and there is none like You among the gods , Lord, strong in mercy and good in strength, in order to help and comfort and save all who hope
in Your name, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and always and forever and ever. Amen.
