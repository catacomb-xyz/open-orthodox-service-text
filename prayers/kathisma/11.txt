Troparion, tone 7

And me, my soul, the hospital of repentance, / come, shedding tears, / exclaiming with a groan to the Physician of souls and bodies: / “Free me, Lover of mankind, from my sins, / count me as a harlot, and a robber, and a publican, / and
grant me O God, forgiveness of my iniquities / and save me!”

Glory: I was not jealous of the repentance of the publican, / and did not acquire the harlot's tears: / for out of insensibility I doubt / in my ability to such correction; / but by Your mercy, save me, Christ God, / as a Lover of mankind.

And now: Mother of God, Virgin, alien to filth, / pray to Your Son with the higher Forces, / to grant us forgiveness of sins before the end / and great mercy.

Lord have mercy (40) and prayer:

Kindle in our hearts, philanthropic Lord, your incorruptible light of the knowledge of God and open the eyes of our mind to comprehend your gospel preaching! Put in us the fear of Your blessed commandments, so that we,
trampling all carnal desires, lead a spiritual life, about everything that pleases You, thinking and doing that. For You are the enlightenment of our souls and bodies, Christ God, and we send glory to You, with Your Father without beginning, and the All-Holy, and the Good,
and Your Life-giving Spirit, now, and always, and forever and ever. Amen.
