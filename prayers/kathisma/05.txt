Troparion, tone 5

Thy Throne is Your Throne of Judgment, my life is vicious; / and who will then deliver me from trouble, / if You do not have mercy on me, Christ God, / as Merciful and Lover of mankind?

Glory: Caring for worldly things expelled me from paradise, / and what should I do, outcast? / Therefore, I knock on the gate and cry out: / “Lord, Lord, open to me, the penitent, / and save me!”

And now: What shall we call Your temple, Mother of God? / Is it a spiritual haven? / Or a paradise of heavenly sweetness, leading to endless life? / For You have every good thing; always pray to Christ / for the salvation of our souls.

Lord have mercy (40) and prayer:

God , righteous and glorious, great and mighty God, eternal God, hear the prayer of a sinful man at this hour: hear me, who promised to hear those who call you in truth, and do not consider me vile, having unclean lips
and bound by sins, the hope of all the ends of the earth and wandering far! Take up arms and shield and rise to my aid; Draw your sword and become a barrier against those who pursue me. Forbid the unclean spirits because of my madness, and may
the spirit of hatred and rancor, the spirit of envy and flattery, the spirit of fear and despondency, the spirit of pride and all other malice be separated from my thoughts; and may all the inflaming and movement of my flesh, arising from the devil's influence, be extinguished, and may my
soul, and body, and spirit with the light of Thy Divine knowledge: so that, according to the multitude of Thy mercies, I may achieve unity in faith, to the extent of the age of a perfect husband, and glorify with the Angels and all Thy saints your many-honored and beautiful name, the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit now and always and forever and ever. Amen.
