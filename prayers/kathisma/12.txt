Troparion, tone 7

From the weed of a harlot and Peter, O Lord, / and justified the publican, / who sighed from the depths of his heart, / and over me, in contrition, falling to You, / have pity, Savior, / and have mercy on me.

Glory: Accept me as a publican, Lord, / as a harlot, cleanse me, Master, / as a Canaanite woman, have mercy / according to Your great mercy.

And now: Mother of Light, Blessed Mother of God, / pray to Christ God / that the morning will shine / and great mercy to our souls.

Lord have mercy (40) and prayer:

Lord , my God, One is good and philanthropic, One is merciful and meek, One is true and righteous, One is generous and merciful our God! May Your power come upon me, Your sinful and indecent servant, and may
it strengthen the temple of my soul with the good news of Your Divine teaching. Lord and Lover of mankind, loving kindness, loving mercy, enlighten my heart and whole body with Your will. Cleanse me from all malice and sin, keep me free from filth and vice
from all influx and influence of the devil, and grant me, according to Your goodness, what is pleasing to You to know, what is pleasing to You to think and live according to Your will, to be filled with fear before You, in order to do what is pleasing to You to the last my breath
so that, by Your inscrutable mercy, You would keep my body and soul, both mind and thoughts, a temple that did not suffer from any network laid out on the way. My Lord, Lord, cover me with Your mercy and do not leave me, a sinner, and an unclean,
and unworthy servant of Yours: for You are my Protector, Lord, and my singing is always about You, and we send glory to You, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit now, and always, and forever and ever. Amen.
