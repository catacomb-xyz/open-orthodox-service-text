Troparion, tone 3

X the shaft I bring to You, Lord, / I declare all my sins to You; / God, turning, have mercy on me.

Glory: Save me, my God, / as you once saved the publican, / and did not despise the harlot's tears; / accept my sigh, my Savior, / and save me.

And now: As a slave, I now resort / to Your protection, Immaculate: / deliver me, Mother of God, from passionate embarrassment, / for You have given birth to the Culprit of passionlessness.

Lord have mercy (40) and prayer:

We thank You, Lord our God, for all Your good deeds, which from childhood to this day have been done on us, unworthy ones: about those that we know and do not know, about those that we know and do not know, about those that were obvious and hidden, by deed and by word. You
have loved us so much that You have been pleased to give Your only begotten Son for us. Help us to be worthy of Your love. Grant us wisdom by Your word and by Your fear, inhale strength from Your power, and if we have voluntarily or involuntarily
sinned, forgive and do not blame. And save our soul in holiness, and place it before Your throne having a clear conscience, and give it an end worthy of Your humanity. And remember, O Lord, all who call upon Your name in truth: remember all,
wishing us good or hostile: for we are all people, and every man is vain. Therefore, we pray to You, Lord: give us great mercy of Your mercy.
