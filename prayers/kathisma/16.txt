Troparion, tone 1

And noah the world awaits you, soul, / and the Judge intends to expose your secret and evil deeds. / Do not remain immersed in the earthly, / but before the end, call on the Judge: / “God, cleanse me and save me!”

Glory: With many sins and countless ulcers / I am embraced, Savior, sinning, / but I pray Your mercy, Christ: / “Doctor of the sick, visit, / and heal, and save me!”

And now: My soul, why do you carelessly live in laziness? / Why are you not worried about the evil deeds / that you have committed in life? / Try to improve / before the Lord closes the door for you. / Run to the Mother of God, fall down and cry out: / “Hope of the
hopeless , save me, / who has sinned against You a lot, Most Pure Lady!”

Lord have mercy (40) and prayer:

Holy Lord, who lives in the highest and sees all creation with Your all-seeing eye! Before Thee we bow with soul and body, and we pray to Thee, Holy One of saints: stretch out Thy invisible hand from Thy holy habitation, and bless
us all, and forgive us every sin, both voluntary and involuntary, in word or deed. Grant us, Lord, tenderness, grant spiritual tears from the soul to cleanse many of our sins, grant Your great mercy to Your world and to us,
Your unworthy servants. For blessed and glorious is Your name, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and always and forever and ever. Amen.
