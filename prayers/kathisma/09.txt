Troparion, tone 6

I think of a terrible day / and mourn my evil deeds. / How will I answer the Immortal King? / Or how dare I, the prodigal, look at the Judge? / Merciful Father, Only-begotten Son, / Holy Spirit, have mercy on me!

Glory: In the valley of weeping, / in the place that You appointed, / when you sit down, Merciful, to create a righteous judgment, / do not expose my innermost / and do not shame me before the Angels, / but have mercy on me, O God, and have mercy on me.

And now: Hope and strong protection of those who resort to You, / Mother of God, / good Defender of the world, / fervently pray with the incorporeal / the most loving God born by You, / for the deliverance of our souls from any punishment, / O Blessed One.

Lord have mercy (40) and prayer:

Lord, our God, You alone know the disease of my unfortunate soul and the way to heal it ! Heal her, as You know, according to the abundance of Your mercy and Your compassion, because from my works there is not a plaster to
apply to her, nor oil, nor a bandage. But You, who came to call not the righteous, but sinners to repentance, have mercy, have mercy, forgive her. Tear apart the handwriting of my many and shameful deeds and direct me to Your straight path, so that, walking in Your truth
, I could avoid the arrows of the evil one and so appear, without being judged, before Your terrible throne, glorifying and singing Your most holy name forever. Amen.
