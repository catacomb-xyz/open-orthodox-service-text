Troparion, tone 7

I thank and glorify You, my God, / for the fact that You gave all sinners repentance. / When you come to judge the whole world, / do not shame me, Savior, / who did the shameful deeds.

Glory: I have sinned against You immeasurably, / I expect immeasurable torment. / My God, take pity, / save me!

And now: To Your immeasurable mercy / I now resort: / break, O Mother of God, / the fetters of my sins.

Lord have mercy (40) and prayer:

In the Lord Christ God, Healed my passions with His sufferings and healed my wounds with His wounds! Grant me, who have sinned much before You, tears of tenderness. Grant my body to receive the fragrance of
Your life-giving Body, and give my soul the sweetness of Your precious Blood instead of the bitterness that the enemy gave me to drink. Raise to Thee my mind, drooping to the ground, and raise me out of the perilous abyss. For there is no repentance in me, no tenderness in me, no tears in me
comforting, leading children to their inheritance. I have darkened my mind in worldly passions, in illness I cannot look at You, I cannot warm myself with tears of love for You! But, Master Lord Jesus Christ, Treasury of blessings! Grant me
complete repentance and a heart that labors with love in search of You, grant me Your grace and renew in me the features of Your image. I left you - don't leave me. Come out to look for me, bring me to Your pasture and introduce me to the sheep of Your chosen
flock, raise me with them from the bread of Your Divine Sacraments, through the prayers of Your Most Pure Mother and all Your saints. Amen.
