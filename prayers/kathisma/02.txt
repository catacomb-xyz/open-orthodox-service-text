Troparion, tone 2

I am a barren tree, O Lord, / I bear no fruit of contrition at all, / and I fear being cut down, / and I fear that inextinguishable fire. / Therefore, I pray to you: / “Before that trouble, turn and save me!”

As the waves of the sea / my iniquities rose up against me, / like a ship in the abyss, / I alone suffer from the storm of many sins; / but guide me to a quiet harbor, O Lord, / with repentance and save me.

Glory: “Have mercy on me,” David said, / and I cry out to You: / “I have sinned, Savior; / Having blotted out my sins with repentance, have mercy on me!”

And now: Hot Defender of Christians, / pray to Your Son, Mother of God, / deliver us by mercy and compassion / from all villainy and ferocity of the enemy, / and by Your prayers give us forgiveness of everything / in which we have sinned, Mother Virgin!

Lord have mercy (40) and prayer:

Lord Almighty, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Only Begotten Son, grant me an undefiled body, a pure heart, a cheerful mind, a thought without error, the coming of the Holy Spirit, that I may receive the fullness of the truth in Your
Christ - with Him glory befits You, honor and worship with the Holy Spirit now, and always, and forever and ever. Amen.
