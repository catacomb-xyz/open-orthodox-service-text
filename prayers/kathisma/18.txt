Troparion, tone 2

Before my condemnation, / my Lord, Lord, / grant me the conversion and correction of many of my sins, / grant me spiritual contrition, / so that I cry out to You: / “Merciful Lover of mankind, / my God, save
me !”

Glory: Having become like unreasonable cattle, / I, the prodigal, became equal to them; / grant me conversion, O Christ, / may I receive great mercy from you.

And now: O Lady, do not turn away Your face / from me praying to You, / but, as the merciful Mother of the compassionate God, / hasten before the end to grant me conversion, / so that I, saved by Your intercession, may sing praises to You / as
salvation and hope my reliable, my Lady.

Lord have mercy (40) and prayer:

Lord, do not rebuke me in Your wrath and do not punish me with Your wrath. Master Lord, Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, have mercy on me, a sinner, a beggar, naked, lazy, negligent, rebellious, unfortunate, fornicator,
adulterer, vicious, depraved, filthy, erring, ungrateful, unmerciful, cruel, with a burnt conscience, ugly who has neither boldness nor justification, unworthy of Your love for mankind and worthy of every
punishment, and hell, and torment. And do not expose me, Redeemer, because of the multitude of my sins so great to many torments, but have mercy on me, for I am weak both in soul, and in flesh, and in mind, and in thought; and in the ways known to you, save me, your unworthy
servant, through the prayers of our Most Pure Lady Theotokos, and all the saints who have pleased you from time immemorial: for you are blessed forever and ever. Amen.
