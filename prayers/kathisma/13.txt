Troparion, tone 8

Of whom the merciful, Lord, / look at my humility: / for little by little my life is shortened, / and there is no salvation for me from works. / Therefore, I pray: / “With the merciful eye, Lord, / look at my humility / and save me!”

Glory: As if standing before the Judge, / take care, soul, / and think about the coming of a terrible day, / for judgment without mercy has not shown mercy. / Call on Christ God: / “Seer of the heart, I have sinned, / before my condemnation, have mercy on me!”

And now: Your terrible and terrible / and incorruptible judgment, Christ, / imagining the day and the hour in my mind, / I tremble like a villain, / having collected shameful deeds and evil deeds: / I alone did them diligently. / Therefore, with fear, I bow down before You,
/ crying out in contrition: / “Through the prayers of She Who gave birth to You, / Many-merciful One, save me!”

Lord have mercy (40) and prayer:

Holy Lord, who lives on high and sees all creation with Your all-seeing eye! Before Thee we bowed in soul and body, and we pray to Thee, Holy One of saints: stretch out Thy invisible hand from Thy holy habitation, and bless
us all, and if we have sinned against Thee voluntarily and involuntarily, You, as a good and philanthropic God, Forgive me, granting us Thy earthly blessings. For You have mercy and save us, our God, and we give glory to You, Father and Son and Holy Spirit,
now and always and forever and ever. Amen.
