Seeing that we have no boldness on account of the multitude of our sins, do thou fervently entreat him who was born of thee, 0 Virgin Theotokos: for the supplication of a mother availeth much to win the Master's favour. Despise not the supplications of sinners, 0 all pure one, for merciful and mighty to save is he who graciously deigned to suffer for our sake.

Psalm 78:8-9
Let thy compassions quickly go before us, 0 Lord, for we are become exceedingly poor.
Help us, 0 God our Saviour, for the sake of the glory of thy name; deliver us, O Lord, and be forgiving unto our sins for thy name's sake.

Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us. (Thrice)

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.

O Most Holy Trinity, have mercy on us. O Lord, blot out our sins. O Master, pardon our iniquities. O Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for Thy name's sake.

Lord have mercy. (Thrice)

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.

Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come; thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
