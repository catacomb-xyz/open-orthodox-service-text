Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, in the city of our God, in His holy mountain. Well planted, the joy of the whole earth,

On the mountains of Sion, on the sides of the north, is the city of the great king.

God is known in her palaces, when He cometh to her help.

For lo, the kings of the earth were assembled; they came together.

When they saw her so, they marvelled, they were troubled, they were moved; trembling took hold upon them, there were pains, as of a woman in travail.

With a vehement wind shalt Thou shatter the ships of Tharsis.

As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God.

God hath established it for ever.

We have thought of Thy mercy, O God, in the midst of Thy people.

According to Thy name, O God, so is Thy praise unto the ends of the earth; Thy right hand is full of righteousness.

Let Mount Sion rejoice, and let the daughters of Judea be glad, because of Thy judgments, O Lord.

Walk about Sion, and go round about her; tell the towers thereof.

Mark ye well her strength in your hearts, and consider her bulwarks, that ye may tell it to the generation following.

For this is our God for ever and ever; He will shepherd us for evermore.
