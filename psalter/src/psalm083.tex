How beloved are Thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts. My soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God.

Yea, the sparrow hath found her a house, and the turtledove a nest for herself, where she may lay her young; even Thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.

Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house; they shall praise Thee for ever and ever.

Blessed is the man whose help is from Thee; he hath ascended in his heart in the vale of weeping, even in the place which he hath set.

For the lawgiver shall give blessings, they shall go from strength to strength; the God of gods shall be seen in Sion.

O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob.

Behold, O God our defender, and look upon the face of Thine anointed.

For one day in Thy courts is better than thousands. I have chosen to be an outcast in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of sinners.

For the Lord loveth mercy and truth, God will give grace and glory; no good thing will the Lord withhold from them that walk in innocence.

O Lord God of hosts, blessed is the man that hopeth in Thee.
