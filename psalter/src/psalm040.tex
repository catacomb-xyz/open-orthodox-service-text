Blessed is the man that considereth the poor and needy; the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble.

May the Lord preserve him, and give him life, and make him blessed upon the earth, and deliver him not into the hands of his enemies.

May the Lord help him upon his bed of pain; Thou wilt turn all his bed to health in his sickness.

I said: O Lord, be merciful unto me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee.

Mine enemies have spoken evils against me, saying: When shall he die, and his name perish?

And if he came to see me, his heart speaketh vanity; he gathered iniquity to himself; he went abroad, and spake in like manner.

All they that hate me whispered together against me; they devised evils against me.

They set down a wicked word against me, saying: Shall he that sleepeth rise up again?

Yea, even the man of my peace, in whom I hoped, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.

But Thou, O Lord, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, and I will repay them.

By this I know that Thou hast delighted in me, because mine enemy shall not rejoice over me.

And because of mine innocence Thou hast helped me, and hast established me before Thy face for ever.

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. So be it. So be it.
