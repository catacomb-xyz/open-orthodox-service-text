Out of the depths have I cried unto Thee, O Lord; Lord, hear my voice.

Let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.

If Thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?

For there is forgiveness with Thee.

For Thy Name's sake have I waited for Thee, O Lord; my soul hath waited for Thy word, my soul hath hoped in the Lord.

From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch, let Israel hope in the Lord.

For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption; and He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
