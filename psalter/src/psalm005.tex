Give ear to my words, O Lord; hear my cry. Attend unto the voice of my supplication, my King, and my God; for unto Thee will I pray, O Lord.

My voice shalt Thou hear in the morning; in the morning will I stand before Thee, and Thou shalt look upon me; for Thou art not a God that willest iniquity.

Neither shall the evil doer dwell with Thee, nor shall transgressors continue in Thy sight.

Thou hast hated all workers of iniquity; Thou shalt destroy all them that speak falsehood.

The Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.

But as for me, I will come into Thy house in the multitude of Thy mercy: in Thy fear will I worship toward Thy holy temple.

Lead me, O Lord, in Thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make my way straight before Thy face.

For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain.

Their throat is an open sepulchre, they deceived with their tongues; judge Thou them, O God.

Let them fall by their own counsels, cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have embittered Thee, O Lord.

But let all those that put their hope in Thee be glad; they shall rejoice for ever, and Thou shalt dwell among them. And all they that love Thy name shall glory in thee,

For Thou wilt bless the righteous. O Lord, Thou hast crowned us as with a shield of Thy favour.
