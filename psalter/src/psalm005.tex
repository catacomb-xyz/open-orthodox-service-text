Give ear to my words, O Lord; understand my cry. Hearken unto the voice of my supplication, my King, and my God; for unto thee will I pray, O Lord.

My voice shalt thou hear in the morning; in the morning will I stand before thee, and thou shalt look upon me; for thou art not a God that willest iniquity.

Neither shall the evil doer dwell with thee, nor shall transgressors continue in thy sight.

Thou hast hated all workers of iniquity; thou shalt destroy all them that speak leasing.

The Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.

But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.

Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make my way straight before thy face.

For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain.

Their throat is an open sepulchre, they deceived with their tongues; judge thou them, O God.

Let them fall by their own counsels, cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness; for they have embittered thee, O Lord.

But let all those that put their hope in thee be glad; they shall rejoice for ever, and thou shalt dwell among them. And all they that love thy name shall glory in thee,

For thou wilt bless the righteous. O Lord, thou hast crowned us as with a shield of thy favour.
