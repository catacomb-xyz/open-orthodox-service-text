If it had not been that the Lord was with us, now may Israel say; if it had not been that the Lord was with us, when men rose up against us; then they had swallowed us up alive.

When their wrath was kindled against us, then the waters had overwhelmed us.

Our soul had passed through the torrent; then had our soul passed through the overwhelming water.

Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.

Our soul hath been delivered, as a sparrow out of the snare of the hunters.

The snare is broken, and we are delivered.

Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
