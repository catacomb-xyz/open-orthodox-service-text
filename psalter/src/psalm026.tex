The Lord is my light, and my saviour; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the defender of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

When the wicked came upon me to eat up my flesh, even them that afflict me and are mine enemies,

They were weakened, and fell.

Though an host should array itself against me, my heart shall not fear; Though war should rise against me, in this have I hoped.

One thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the delight of the Lord, and to visit His holy temple.

For in the day of my troubles He hid me in His tabernacle; in the secret of His tabernacle He sheltered me; He set me up upon a rock.

And now, behold, He hath lifted up my head above mine enemies.

I went round about, and offered in His tabernacle a sacrifice of praise and joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord.

Hear my voice, O Lord, wherewith I have cried; have mercy upon me, and hear me.

My heart hath said unto Thee, I will seek the Lord. My face hath sought Thee; Thy face, Lord, will I seek.

Turn not away Thy face from me, and turn not Thou away in anger from Thy servant.

Be Thou my help, cast me not away; neither forsake me, O God my Saviour.

For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord hath taken me to Himself.

Teach me Thy way, O Lord, and lead me in the right path, because of mine enemies.

Deliver me not over to the souls of those that trouble me; for unjust witnesses are risen up against me, and injustice hath lied within itself.

I believe that I shall see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.

Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and let Thine heart be strengthened; and wait on the Lord.
