Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; for my soul hath hoped in Thee. Yea, in the shadow of Thy wings will I hope, until iniquity be overpast.

I will cry unto God Most High, unto God my benefactor.

He hath sent from heaven, and saved me; He hath made them a reproach that trod me down.

God hath sent forth His mercy and His truth, and hath delivered my soul from the midst of the young lions; I slept, troubled.

As for the sons of men, their teeth are weapons and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and Thy glory above all the earth.

They have prepared a snare for my feet, and bowed down my soul. They have digged a pit before me, and they are fallen into it themselves.

My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready; I will sing, and give praise.

Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp; I myself will awake right early.

I will praise Thee, O Lord, among the people; I will sing unto Thee among the nations.

For Thy mercy is magnified unto the heavens, and Thy truth unto the clouds.

Be Thou exalted, O Lord, above the heavens, and Thy glory above all the earth.
