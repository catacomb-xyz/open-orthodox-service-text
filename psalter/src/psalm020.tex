The king shall be glad in Thy strength, O Lord, and in Thy salvation greatly shall he rejoice.

Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withheld the requests of his lips.

For Thou hast prevented him with the blessings of goodness; Thou hast set a crown of precious stone on his head.

He asked life of Thee, and Thou gavest him length of days for ever and ever.

His glory is great in Thy salvation; glory and majesty shalt Thou lay upon him.

For Thou shalt give him blessing for ever and ever; Thou shalt make him exceeding glad with Thy countenance.

For the king hopeth in the Lord, and through the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved.

Let Thine hand be found on all Thine enemies; let Thy right hand find out all those that hate Thee.

For Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of Thy presence; the Lord shall trouble them in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them.

Their fruit shalt Thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.

For they intended evils against Thee; they imagined devices, which they shall not be able to perform.

For Thou shalt make them turn their back; Thou shalt make ready their presence among them that are Thy remnant.

Be Thou exalted, Lord, in Thine own strength; we will sing and praise Thy mighty acts.
