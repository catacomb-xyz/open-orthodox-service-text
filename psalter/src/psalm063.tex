Hearken unto my prayer, O God, when I make supplication unto Thee; deliver my soul from fear of the enemy.

Shelter me from the council of them that work iniquity, from the multitude of the workers of unrighteousness.

They have sharpened their tongue like a sword, they have bent their bow as a bitter deed, that they may shoot in secret at the blameless one.

Suddenly will they shoot at him, and fear not; they have strengthened themselves with a wicked word.

They have spoken of hiding snares; they said: Who shall see them?

They have searched out iniquities; they have grown weary in their seeking.

A man shall approach, and the heart is deep; and God shall be exalted.

As an arrow of infants are their blows, and their tongues are made weak against them.

All that saw them were troubled, and every man was afraid.

And they declared the works of God, and His deeds they understood.

The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and shall hope in Him, and all the upright in heart shall be praised.
