Hear my prayer, O God, when I pray unto Thee; deliver my soul from fear of the enemy.

Shelter me from the council of them that work iniquity, from the multitude of the workers of unrighteousness.

They have sharpened their tongue like a sword, they have bent their bow, a bitter matter, that they may shoot in secret at the blameless one.

Suddenly will they shoot at him, and will not fear; they have encouraged themselves with a wicked word.

They have communed of laying snares privily; they said, Who shall see them?

They have searched out iniquities; they have wearied themselves with a diligent search.

Man shall approach, and the heart is deep; and God shall be exalted.

As an arrow of babes are their blows, and their tongues were weakened against them.

All that saw them were troubled, and all men feared.

And they declared the works of God, and understood His doings.

The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and shall hope in Him, and all the upright in heart shall be praised.
