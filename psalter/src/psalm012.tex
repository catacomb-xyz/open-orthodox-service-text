How long wilt Thou forget me, O Lord, for ever? How long wilt Thou turn away Thy face from me?

How long shall I take counsel in my soul, with sorrow in my heart day and night?

How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?

Consider and hear me, O Lord my God; lighten my eyes, lest I sleep in death;

Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him.

Those that trouble me will rejoice when I am moved, but I have trusted in Thy mercy.

My heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation; I will sing unto the Lord, which hath dealt bountifully with me, and I will sing unto the Name of the Lord Most High.
