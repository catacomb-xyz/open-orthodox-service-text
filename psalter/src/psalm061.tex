Shall not my soul be subject to God? For from Him cometh my salvation.

For He is my God, my Saviour and my helper; and I shall be moved no more.

How long do ye assail a man? Ye slay, all of you, as a leaning wall, and as a tottering fence.

But they consulted to impugn mine honour; they ran in lies; they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.

But be thou subject unto God, my soul, for my endurance is from Him.

For He only is my God, my Saviour and my helper; and I shall not be moved.

In God is my salvation and my glory; He is the God of my help, and my hope is in God.

Hope in Him, all ye congregation of the people; pour out your heart before Him, for God is our helper.

For the sons of men are vain, the sons of men are liars in the balance; out of vanity they gather themselves together, that they may work injustice.

Hope not in injustice, and covet not plunder; if riches flow, set not your heart upon them.

God hath spoken once, and these two things have I heard: that power belongeth unto God; also unto Thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy, for Thou shalt render to every man according to his works.
