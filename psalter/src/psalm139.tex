Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man; from the unrighteous man rescue me;

Who have imagined injustice in their heart; all the day long have they prepared for war.

They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; the poison of asps is under their lips.

Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the sinner; rescue me from unjust men who have conspired to overthrow my goings.

The proud have hid a snare for me, and with cords spread a net for my feet; they have set stumbling blocks for me beside the way.

I said unto the Lord: Thou art my God; give ear, O Lord, unto the voice of my supplication.

O Lord, O Lord, Thou strength of my salvation; Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.

Deliver me not, O Lord, to the sinner, according to my desire. They have consulted against me; forsake me not, lest they should be exalted.

As for the head of those that compass me about, the mischief of their lips shall cover them.

Coals shall fall upon them; into the fire Thou shalt cast them down, and they shall not stand in afflictions.

A babbling man shall not prosper upon the earth; evils shall hunt an unrighteous man unto destruction.

I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the needy, and the justice of the poor.

Verily, the righteous shall give thanks unto Thy Name, and the upright shall dwell in Thy presence.
