Be merciful unto me, O God, for man hath trodden me down; fighting all the day long, he hath afflicted me.

Mine enemies have trodden me down all the day long, for they be many that fight against me from on high.

By day I will not fear, but I will hope in Thee.

In God I will praise my words, in God have I put my hope; I will not be afraid what flesh can do unto me.

All the day long they abhorred my words; all their thoughts were against me for evil.

They will dwell near, and hide themselves; they will mark where I set my heel, even as they have waited for my soul.

By no means shalt Thou save them; in anger shalt Thou cast down the people, O God.

I have declared my life unto Thee; Thou hast set my tears before Thee.

Even as Thou hast promised, mine enemies shall be turned back. In the day that I call upon Thee, behold, I know that Thou art God.

In God will I praise His word; in the Lord will I praise His speech.

In God have I put my hope; I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.

Thy vows are upon me, O God, which I will render in praise of Thee.

For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling; that I may be well pleasing before the Lord in the light of the living.
