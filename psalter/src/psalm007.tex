O Lord my God, in thee have I put my hope; save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me.

Lest he seize my soul like a lion, while there is none to deliver or to save.

O Lord my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;

If I have rewarded evils unto them that rewarded me evils, then let me fall empty from mine enemies.

Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay my glory in the dust.

Arise, O Lord, in thine anger; lift up thyself in the uttermost borders of thine enemies.

And awake, O Lord my God, in the commandment that thou hast commanded, and a congregation of the people shall compass thee about. For their sakes therefore return thou on high.

The Lord shall judge the people. Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to mine innocence that is in me.

Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but direct thou the just, O God, that searchest the hearts and reins.

Righteous is my help from God, which saveth the upright in heart.

God is a righteous judge, strong and forbearing, and inflicteth not anger every day.

If ye turn not, he will furbish his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.

And he hath prepared on it the instruments of death; he hath ordained his arrows for them that burn.

Behold, he hath travailed with iniquity; he hath conceived toil, and brought forth wickedness.

He opened a pit, and digged it, and shall fall into the ditch which he made.

His travail shall return upon his own head, and his unrighteousness shall come down upon his own pate.

I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High.
