O God, Thou hast cast us off, and hast destroyed us; Thou hast been angry, and hast had mercy upon us.

Thou hast made the land to tremble, and hast troubled it; heal Thou the breaches thereof, for it hath been shaken.

Thou hast shown Thy people hard things; Thou hast made us to drink the wine of sorrow.

Thou hast given a sign unto them that fear Thee, that they may flee from before the bow.

That Thy beloved may be delivered, save with Thy right hand, and hear Thou me.

God hath spoken in His holiness, I will exult, and divide Sichem, and measure out the valley of tents.

Galaad is Mine, and Manasses is Mine; Ephraim also is the strength of My head; Judea is My king.

Moab is the pot of My hope, over Idumea will I stretch forth My shoe; the strangers are made subject unto Me.

Who will lead Me into a fortified city? Or who will bring Me into Idumea?

Will not Thou, O God, who hast cast us off? And wilt not Thou, O God, go out with our hosts?

Give us help from trouble, for vain is the salvation of man.

Through God we shall do mightily, and He shall bring those that trouble us to nought.
