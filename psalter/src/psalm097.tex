O sing unto the Lord a new song, for the Lord hath done marvellous things.

His right hand, and His holy arm, have wrought salvation for Him.

The Lord hath made known His salvation; His righteousness hath He openly showed in the sight of the heathen.

He hath remembered His mercy to Jacob, and His truth to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth; sing, rejoice, and sing praise.

Sing unto the Lord with the harp, with the harp, and the voice of a psalm; with trumpets, and the sound of a horn.

Make a joyful noise before the Lord our King; let the sea be moved, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all they that dwell therein.

The floods shall clap their hands, the mountains shall rejoice at the presence of the Lord; for He cometh, He cometh to judge the earth.

With righteousness shall He judge the world, and the people with equity.
