O sing unto the Lord a new song, for the Lord hath done marvellous things.

His right hand and His holy arm have wrought salvation for Him.

The Lord hath made known His salvation; In the presence of the nations hath he revealed His righteousness.

He hath remembered His mercy to Jacob, and His truth to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

Shout with joy unto the Lord, all the earth; sing, rejoice, and chant psalms.

Sing unto the Lord with the harp, with the harp and the voice of a psalm; with trumpets and the sound of a horn.

Shout with joy before the Lord our King; let the sea be moved, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all they that dwell therein.

The rivers shall clap their hands, the mountains shall rejoice at the presence of the Lord; for He cometh, He cometh to judge the earth.

With righteousness shall He judge the world, and the people with uprightness.
