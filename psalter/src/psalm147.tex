Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Sion.

For He hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; He hath blessed thy children within thee.

He bringeth peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the fat of the wheat.

He sendeth forth His commandment to the earth; His word runneth very swiftly.

He giveth His snow like wool; He scattereth the mist like ashes.

He casteth forth His ice like morsels; who can stand before His cold?

He shall send out His word, and melt them; His wind shall blow, and the waters shall flow.

He showeth His word unto Jacob, His statutes and His judgments unto Israel.

He hath not dealt so with every nation, neither hath He shown His judgments unto them.
