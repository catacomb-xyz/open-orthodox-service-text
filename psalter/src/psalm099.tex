Make a joyful noise unto God, all the earth; serve the Lord with gladness.

Come before His presence with rejoicing.

Know ye that the Lord, He is our God; it is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.

Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise; be thankful unto Him, and praise His Name.

For the Lord is good; His mercy endureth for ever and ever, and His truth from generation to generation.
