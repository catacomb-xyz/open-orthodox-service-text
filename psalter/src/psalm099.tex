Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth.

Serve the Lord with gladness; come before His presence with exceeding great joy.

Know ye that the Lord Himself is our God; it is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves; for we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.

Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise; give thanks unto Him, and praise His Name.

For the Lord is good; His mercy endureth for ever, and His truth from generation to generation.
