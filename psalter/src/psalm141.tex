I cried unto the Lord with my voice; with my voice unto the Lord did I make supplication.

I will pour out my supplication before Him; I will show before Him my trouble.

When my spirit was fainting within me, then Thou knewest my paths; in this way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.

I looked on my right hand, and beheld; but there was none that knew me.

Flight failed me, and there is none that watcheth for my soul.

I cried unto Thee, O Lord; I said: Thou art my hope, my portion in the land of the living.

Attend unto my supplication, for I am brought very low.

Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I.

Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise Thy Name.

The righteous shall await me, until Thou shalt reward me.
