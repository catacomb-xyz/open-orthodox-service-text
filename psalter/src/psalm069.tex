O God, attend to my help. O Lord, make haste to help me.

Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire evils against me.

Let them at once be turned back in shame that say to me: Well done, well done!

Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee, O God, and let them that love Thy salvation say continually: The Lord be magnified.

But as for me, I am poor and needy; O God, help me. My helper and deliverer art Thou, O Lord; make no long tarrying.
