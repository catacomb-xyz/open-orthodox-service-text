O God, draw near to help me; O Lord, make haste to help me.

Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul; let them be turned backward and brought to shame that desire my
hurt.

Let them be turned back at once ashamed that say to me: Well done, well done!

Let all those that seek Thee, O God, be glad and rejoice in Thee; and let such as love Thy salvation say continually: The Lord be magnified.

But I am poor and needy; help me, O God. Thou art my help and deliverer; Lord, make no long tarrying.
