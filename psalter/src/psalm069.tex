O God, draw near to help me; O Lord, make haste to help me.

Let them be shamed and confounded that seek after my soul; let them be turned backward and brought to shame that desire my hurt.

Let them at once be turned back in shame that say to me: Well done, well done!

Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee, O God, and let them that love Thy salvation say continually: The Lord be magnified.

But as for me, I am poor and needy; O God, help me. Thou art my helper and deliverer; Lord, make no long tarrying.
