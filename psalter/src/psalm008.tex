O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is Thy Name in all the earth! For Thy majesty is exalted above the heavens.

Out of the mouths of infants and sucklings hast Thou perfected praise because of Thine enemies, that thou mightest destroy the enemy and the avenger.

For I will consider the heavens, the works of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained.

What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? Or the son of man, that Thou visitest him?

Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels; Thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, and hast made him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands.

Thou hast put all things under his feet: all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field.

The fowls of the air, and the fish of the sea, the creatures that pass through the paths of the sea.

O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is Thy Name in all the earth!
