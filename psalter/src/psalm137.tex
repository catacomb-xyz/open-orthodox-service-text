I will give Thee thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart: and before angels will I sing praise unto Thee; for Thou hast heard all the words of my mouth.

I will worship toward Thy holy temple, and give thanks unto Thy Name, for Thy mercy and Thy truth; for Thou hast magnified Thy holy Name above all that is.

In whatsoever day that I shall call upon Thee, quickly hearken unto me; Thou shalt endow my soul abundantly with Thy strength.

Let all the kings of the earth give Thee thanks, O Lord, for they have heard all the words of Thy mouth.

Yea, let them sing in the ways of the Lord, for great is the glory of the Lord.

For the Lord is high, yet hath He regard unto the lowly; but the proud He knoweth from afar.

Though I walk in the midst of trouble, Thou wilt revive me; Thou hast stretched forth Thy hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and Thy right hand hath saved me.

The Lord shall repay for me; Thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever; despise not the work of Thy hands.
