I will give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: and before angels will I sing praises unto Thee; for Thou hast heard all the words of my mouth.

I will worship toward Thy holy temple, and give thanks unto Thy Name on account of Thy mercy and Thy truth; for Thou hast magnified Thy holy Name above all that is.

In whatsoever day that I should call upon Thee, quickly hearken unto me; Thou shalt strengthen my soul abundantly with Thy power.

Let all the kings of the earth give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, for they have heard all the words of Thy mouth.

Yea, let them sing in the ways of the Lord, for great is the glory of the Lord.

For the Lord is on high, yet He hath regard unto the lowly; but the proud He knoweth from afar.

If I should walk in the midst of affliction, Thou wilt quicken me; against the wrath of mine enemies Thou hast stretched forth Thy hands, and Thy right hand hath saved me.

O Lord, Thou shalt recompense them on my behalf. Thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever; despise not the work of Thy hands.
