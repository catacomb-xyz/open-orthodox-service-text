The Lord hear Thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend Thee.

Send Thee help from the sanctuary, and help Thee out of Sion.

Remember all Thy sacrifices, and fatten Thy whole burnt offering.

The Lord grant Thee according to Thine own heart, and fulfil all Thy counsels.

We will rejoice in Thy salvation, and in the name of the Lord our God shall we be magnified.

The Lord fulfil all Thy petitions. Now know I that the Lord hath saved His Anointed.

He will hear him from his holy heaven; in mighty deeds is the salvation of His right hand.

Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will call upon the name of the Lord our God.

They are bound, and are fallen, but we are risen, and set upright.

O Lord, save the king, and hear us in the day wherein we call upon Thee.
