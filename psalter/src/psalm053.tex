Save me, O God, by Thy name, and judge me by Thy strength.

Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.

For strangers are risen up against me, and the mighty have sought after my soul, and they have not set God before them.

For behold, God helpeth me, and the Lord is the protector of my soul.

He shall bring evils upon mine enemies; cut them off in Thy truth.

I will freely sacrifice unto Thee; I will praise Thy name, O Lord, for it is good.

For Thou hast delivered me out of all trouble, and mine eye hath looked down upon mine enemies.
