Hear this, all ye nations; give ear, all ye that inhabit the world.

All ye that were born of earth, and ye sons of men; rich and poor together.

My mouth shall speak of wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.

I will incline mine ear to the proverb; I will lay open my problem upon the harp.

Wherefore should I fear in the day of evil? The iniquity at my heel shall compass me about.

There be some that trust in their strength, and boast themselves in the multitude of their wealth.

A brother cannot redeem; shall a man redeem?

He shall not give to God a ransom for himself, nor the price of the redemption of his soul, even though he hath laboured for ever, and shall live to the end.

For he shall not see corruption, when he seeth wise men die. The senseless and the fool shall perish together, and leave their wealth to others.

And their graves shall be their houses for ever, their dwelling places unto generation and generation; though they have called their lands after their own names.

And man, being in honour, understood not; he is like the mindless cattle, and is become like unto them.

This way of theirs is a stumbling block unto them, yet afterwards they shall please with their mouth.

Like sheep they are laid in hades; death shall be their shepherd.

And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning, and from their glory their help shall rot in hades.

But God will redeem my soul out of the hand of hades, when He receiveth me.

Be not thou afraid when a man becometh rich, nor when the glory of his house is increased.

For when he dieth, he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him.

For his soul shall be blessed in his life; he will acknowledge Thee when Thou doest good unto him.

He shall enter into the generation of his fathers; he shall not see light unto eternity.

And man, being in honour, understood not; he is like the mindless cattle, and is become like unto them.
