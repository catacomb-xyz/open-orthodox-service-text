Unto Thee, O God, will we give thanks; we will give thanks and call upon Thy Name. I will tell of all Thy wondrous works.

When I am given the appointed time, I will judge uprightly.

The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved; I have made fast the pillars thereof.

I said unto the transgressors, Transgress not; and to the sinners, Lift not up the horn.

Lift not up thy horn on high, and speak not unrighteousness against God.

For judgment cometh neither from the byways, nor from the west, nor from the desert mountains: for God is judge.

He putteth down one, and setteth up another; for there in the hand of the Lord there is a full cup of unmingled wine.

And He hath turned it from this to that, but the dregs thereof are not wholly emptied out; all the sinners of the earth shall drink from them.

But I will rejoice for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

All the horns also of the wicked will I break, but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
