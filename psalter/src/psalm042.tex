Judge me, God, and give judgment in my cause against a nation that is not holy; deliver me from an unjust and deceitful man.

For Thou, O God, art my strength: why hast Thou cast me off, and why go I mourning while mine enemy oppresseth me?

O send out Thy light and Thy truth; they have led me, and brought me unto Thy holy mountain, and to Thy tabernacles.

And I will go unto the altar of God, unto God who giveth gladness to my youth; upon the harp will I praise Thee, O God, my God.

Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why dost thou disquiet me? Hope thou in God, for I shall praise Him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
