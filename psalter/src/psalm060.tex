Hear my supplication, O God; attend unto my prayer.

From the ends of the earth have I cried unto Thee, when my heart was overwhelmed; Thou hast lifted me high upon a rock.

Thou hast guided me, for Thou hast been my hope, a strong tower against the face of the enemy.

I will abide in Thy tabernacle for ever; I shall be sheltered under the covert of Thy wings.

For Thou, O God, hast heard my prayers; Thou hast given a heritage to those that fear Thy name.

Thou wilt prolong the kingâ€™s days, his years to generation upon generation.

He shall abide before the face of God for ever; His mercy and truth, who shall search it out?

So will I sing praise unto Thy name for ever and ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
