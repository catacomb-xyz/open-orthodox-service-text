I said: I will take heed to my ways, lest I sin with my tongue. I set a guard for my mouth when the sinner up stood against me.

I was rendered speechless and and made low. I kept silent, even from good words, and my sorrow was renewed.

My heart grew hot within me, and in my meditation a fire was kindled. I spake with my tongue,

O Lord, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is, that I may know what it is wanting to me.

Behold, Thou hast made my days as a handbreadth, and my being is as nothing before Thee. Verily, every man living is altogether vanity.

Surely man walketh about like a shadow; in vain doth he trouble himself. He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not for whom he shall gather it.

And now what is my hope? Is it not the Lord? Yea, my hope is in Thee.

Deliver me from all my transgressions; Thou hast made me a rebuke unto the foolish.

I was rendered speechless, and opened not my mouth, for Thou hast made me.

Remove Thy scourges from me, for I have fainted by the strength of Thy hand.

With rebukes Thou hast chasten man for iniquity, and hast brushed his life away like a spider's web; surely every man is troubled in vain.

Hearken unto my prayer, O Lord, and unto my supplication; give ear unto my tears. Be not silent, for I am a sojourner with Thee, and a stranger, as were all my fathers.

Spare me, that I may be refreshed before I go hence, and be no more.
