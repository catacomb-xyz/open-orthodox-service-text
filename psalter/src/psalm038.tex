I said, I will take heed to my ways, lest I sin with my tongue. I kept my mouth, as it were with a bridle, while the sinner stood
before me.

I was dumb, and humbled myself, and held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was renewed.

My heart grew hot within me, and while I was musing a fire was kindled. I spake with my tongue,

Lord, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know what it is I lack.

Behold, Thou hast made my days as a handbreadth, and my being is as nothing before Thee. Verily, every man living is altogether vanity.

Surely man walketh as an image; he is disquieted in vain. He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not for whom he gathereth them.

And now what is my hope? Is it not the Lord? Yea, my hope is
in Thee.

Deliver me from all my transgressions; Thou hast made me a reproach unto the foolish.

I was dumb, and opened not my mouth, for Thou hast made me.

Remove Thy scourges from me, for I have fainted by the strength of Thine hand.

Thou with rebukes hast corrected man for iniquity, and hast made his life to consume away like a spider's web; surely every man disquieteth himself in vain.

Hear my prayer, Lord, and my supplication; give ear unto my tears. Hold not Thy peace, for I am a sojourner with Thee, and a stranger, as all my fathers were.

O spare me, that I may be refreshed, before I go hence, and be no more.
