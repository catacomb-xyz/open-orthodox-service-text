I was glad because of them that said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord.

Our feet have stood within thy courts, O Jerusalem.

Jerusalem is builded as a city whose fellowship is complete.

For there the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.

For there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones of the house of David.

Ask now for the things which are for the peace of Jerusalem, and for the prosperity of them that love thee.

Let peace be with thy strength, and prosperity within thy palaces.

For the sake of my brethren and companions, I spake peace concerning thee.

Because of the house of the Lord our God, I have sought thy good.
