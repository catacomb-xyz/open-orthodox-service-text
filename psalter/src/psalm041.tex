As the hart panteth after the water springs, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God.

My soul thirsted for God, the mighty, the living; when shall I come and appear before the face of God?

My tears have been my bread day and night, whilst it is said to me daily, Where is thy God?

I remembered these things, and poured out my soul within me; for I will go to the place of the wondrous tabernacle, to the house of God, with the voice of rejoicing and thanksgiving, the sound of those that keep holyday.

Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why dost thou disquiet me? Hope thou in God, for I will praise him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God.

My soul hath been troubled within me; therefore will I remember Thee from the land of Jordan and Hermoniim, from the little mountain.

Deep calleth unto deep at the voice of Thy cataracts; all Thy billows and Thy waves are gone over me.

The Lord will command His mercy in the daytime, and in the night His song shall be with me, my prayer unto the God of my life.

I will say unto God, Thou art my help; why hast Thou forgotten me? And why go I mourning while the enemy oppresseth me?

While my bones were broken, mine enemies reproached me, while they said daily unto me, Where is thy God?

Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why dost thou disquiet me? Hope thou in God, for I will praise Him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
