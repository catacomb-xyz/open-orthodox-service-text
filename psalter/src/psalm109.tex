The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.

The Lord shall send Thee a rod of strength out of Sion; rule Thou in the midst of Thine enemies.

With Thee is dominion in the day of Thy power, in the splendour of Thy saints.

From the womb before the morning star have I begotten Thee.

The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedech.

The Lord at Thy right hand hath broken kings in the day of his wrath.

He shall judge among the heathen, He shall fill them up with the dead bodies; He shall crush the heads of many upon the earth.

He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore shall He lift up his head.
