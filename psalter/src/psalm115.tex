I believed, and therefore have I spoken; I was humbled exceedingly.

I said in my madness: All men are liars.

What shall I render unto the Lord for all that He hath rendered unto me?

I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord.

I will pay my vows unto the Lord, in the presence of all His people.

Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.

O Lord, I am Thy servant; I am Thy servant, and the son of Thy handmaiden; Thou hast broken my bonds asunder.

I will offer unto Thee a sacrifice of praise, and I will call upon the Name of the Lord.

I will pay my vows unto the Lord in the presence of all His people, in the courts of the house of the Lord, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
