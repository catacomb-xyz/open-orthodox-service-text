I lifted up mine eyes unto the mountains, from whence cometh my help.

My help cometh from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.

Let not thy foot be moved, and let not thy keeper slumber.

Behold, He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.

The Lord shall keep thee; the Lord is thy shelter upon thy right hand.

The sun shall not burn thee by day, neither the moon by night.

The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil; the Lord shall preserve thy soul.

The Lord shall preserve thy coming in and thy going out, from this time forth, and even for evermore.
