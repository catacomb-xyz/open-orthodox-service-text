God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause His face to shine upon us; and have mercy on us.

That we may know Thy way upon earth, Thy salvation among all nations.

Let the people praise Thee, O God, let all the people praise Thee.

O let the nations be glad and rejoice, for Thou shalt judge the people with uprightness, and guide the heathen upon earth.

Let the people praise Thee, O God, let all the people praise Thee;

The earth hath yielded its fruit. Let God, even our own God, bless us;

Let God bless us, and let all the ends of the earth fear Him.
