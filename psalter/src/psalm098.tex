The Lord reigneth; let the people rage: He sitteth upon the cherubim, let the earth be moved.

The Lord is great in Sion, and He is high above all the people.

Let them praise Thy great Name, for it is terrible and holy; the king's honour also loveth judgment.

Thou hast established equity, Thou hast executed judgment and righteousness in Jacob.

Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at His footstool; for He is holy.

Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His Name; they called upon the Lord, and He heard them.

He spake unto them in the pillar of the cloud, for they kept His testimonies, and the ordinances that He gave them.

Thou heardest them, O Lord our God; Thou wast ready to forgive them, O God, yet Thou tookest vengeance of all their inventions.

Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at His holy mountain; for the Lord our God is holy.
