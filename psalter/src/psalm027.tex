Unto Thee will I cry, O Lord; my God, be not Thou silent unto me, lest if Thou be silent unto me, I become like them that go down into the pit.

Hear the voice of my supplication, O Lord, when I pray unto Thee, when I lift up my hands toward Thy holy temple.

Draw me not in with the wicked, and destroy me not with the workers of unrighteousness,

Which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.

Give them, Lord, according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours. Give them after the works of their hands; render to them their desert.

Because they have not hearkened to the works of the Lord, and the operations of His hands.

Thou shalt destroy them, and not build them up.

Blessed be the Lord, because He hath heard the voice of my supplication.

The Lord is my helper and defender; my heart trusted in Him, and I am helped; and my flesh hath flourished anew, and willingly will I praise Him.

The Lord is the strength of His people, and the defender of the salvation of His anointed.

Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance; shepherd them, and lift them up for ever.
