Lord, how are they increased that trouble me? Many are they that rise up against me.

Many there be which say to my soul, There is no salvation for
him in his God.

But thou, O Lord, art my helper; my glory, and the lifter up of
mine head.

I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of
his holy mountain.

I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord will help me.

I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.

Arise, O Lord, save me, O my God, for thou hast smitten all them that are mine enemies without a cause; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.

Salvation belongeth unto the Lord, and thy blessing is upon thy people.
