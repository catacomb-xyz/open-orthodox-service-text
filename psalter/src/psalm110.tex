I will give Thee thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.

The works of the Lord are great, sought out in all the acts of His will.

Praise and majesty are His work, and His righteousness endureth for ever and ever.

He hath made His wonderful works to be remembered; the Lord is merciful and full of compassion.

He hath given food unto them that fear Him; He will ever be mindful of His covenant.

He hath shown His people the power of His works, that He may give them the inheritance of the nations.

The works of His hands are truth and judgment; faithful are all His commandments,

Having been established for ever and ever, made in truth and uprightness.

He sent redemption unto His people, He hath commanded His covenant for ever; holy and awesome is His Name.

The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that act accordingly. His praise endureth for ever.
