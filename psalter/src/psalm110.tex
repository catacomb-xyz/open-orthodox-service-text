I will give Thee thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.

The works of the Lord are great, sought out in all that He hath willed.

His work is thanksgiving and majesty, and His righteousness endureth for ever and ever.

He hath made His wonderful works to be remembered; the Lord is merciful and full of compassion.

He hath given meat unto them that fear Him; He will ever be mindful of His covenant.

He hath shown His people the power of His works, that He may give them the heritage of the heathen.

The works of His hands are verity and judgment, all His commandments are sure, made fast for ever and ever, done in truth and uprightness.

He sent redemption unto His people, He hath commanded His covenant for ever; holy and awesome is His Name.

The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and a good understanding have all they that do accordingly.

His praise endureth unto ages of ages
