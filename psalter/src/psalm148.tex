Praise ye the Lord from the heavens; praise Him in the heights.

Praise ye Him, all His angels; praise ye him, all His hosts.

Praise ye Him, sun and moon; praise Him, all ye stars and light.

Praise Him, ye heaven of heavens, and thou water that art above the heavens.

Let them praise the name of the Lord; for He spake, and they came to be; He commanded, and they were created.

He hath stablished them for ever and ever; He hath made a decree, and it shall not pass.

Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons and all deeps.

Fire, and hail, snow, and ice, stormy wind, fulfilling His word;

Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars;

Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and winged fowl;

Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth;

Both young men and maidens; old men, and children;

Let them praise the name of the Lord, for His name alone is exalted.

His praise is above the heaven and earth; He also shall exalt the horn of His people,

A hymn for all His saints; even for the children of Israel, the people that are near unto Him.
