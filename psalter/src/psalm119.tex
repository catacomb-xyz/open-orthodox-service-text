In mine affliction I cried unto the Lord; and He heard me.

Deliver my soul, O Lord, from unjust lips, and from a deceitful tongue.

What shall be given unto thee, or what shall be added unto thee, for a deceitful tongue?

Sharp arrows of the mighty with coals of the desert.

Woe is me, that my sojourn is prolonged; I have dwelt with the tents of Kedar; my soul hath long been a sojourner.

With them that hated peace I was peaceable; when I spake to them, they made war against me without a cause.
