It is a good to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto Thy Name, O Thou Most High.

To show forth Thy mercy in the morning, and Thy truth in the night, upon a psaltery of ten strings, with a song upon the harp.

For Thou, Lord, hast made me glad through Thy works, and I will rejoice in the works of Thy hands.

O Lord, how great are Thy works! Thy thoughts are very deep,

A senseless man knoweth not, neither doth a fool understand this.

When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do look down,

It is that they may be destroyed for ever.

But Thou, Lord, art most High for evermore.

For behold, Thine enemies, O Lord, for behold, Thine enemies shall perish, and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

But my horn shall be exalted like the horn of an unicorn, and mine old age shall be strengthened with rich oil.

Mine eye also hath looked down upon mine enemies, and mine ear shall hear of the wicked that rise up against me.

The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree, and increase like a cedar of Libanus.

Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.

They shall still bring forth fruit in a ripe old age, and happy shall they be to show that Lord our God is upright, and that there is no unrighteousness in Him.
