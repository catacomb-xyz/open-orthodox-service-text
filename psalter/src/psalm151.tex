I was the smallest among my brethren, and the youngest in the house of my father; I shepherded the sheep of my father.

My hands made an instrument, and my fingers fashioned a psaltery.

And who shall tell my Lord? The Lord Himself shall hearken.

He sent His angel, and took me from my fatherâ€™s flocks, and anointed me with the oil of His anointing.

My brethren were big and good, but the Lord took not pleasure in them.

I went forth to meet the stranger, but he cursed me by his idols.

But I drew his own sword, and cut off his head; and I took away the reproach from the children of Israel.
