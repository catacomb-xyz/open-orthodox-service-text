The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all they that dwell therein.

He hath founded it upon the seas, and prepared it upon the rivers.

Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord, or who shall stand in His holy place?

He that is innocent in hands, and pure in heart, who hath not received his soul in vain, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour.

He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his Saviour.

This is the generation of them that seek the Lord, that seek the face of the God of Jacob.

Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting gates; and the King of Glory shall come in.

Who is this King of Glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.

Lift up your gates, ye princes, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting gates; and the King of Glory shall come in.

Who is this King of Glory? The Lord of hosts, He is the King of Glory.
