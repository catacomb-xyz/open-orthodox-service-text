The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad.

Clouds and darkness are round about Him; righteousness and judgment are the foundation of His throne.

A fire shall go before Him, and burn up His enemies round about.

His lightnings shone forth throughout the world; the earth saw, and was moved.

The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

The heavens declared His righteousness, and all the people saw His glory.

Confounded be all they that worship graven things, that boast themselves of their idols; worship Him, all ye His angels.

Sion heard, and was glad, and the daughters of Judea rejoiced because of Thy judgments, O Lord.

For Thou art the Lord Most High over all the earth; Thou art exalted far above all gods.

Ye that love the Lord, hate evil. The Lord preserveth the souls of His saints; He will deliver them from the hand of the wicked.

Light hath dawned for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.

Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous, and give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.
