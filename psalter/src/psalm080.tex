Rejoice in God our helper; shout with joy unto the God of Jacob.

Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant psaltery with the harp.

Sound the trumpet in the new moon, even in the notable day of our feast.

For this is a statute for Israel, and a judgment of the God of Jacob.

This He ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out of the land of Egypt; he heard a language that he knew not.

He removed his back from burdens; his hands had slaved at the basket.

Thou calledst upon Me in trouble, and I delivered thee; I heard thee in the secret place of the tempest, I proved thee at the waters of strife.

Hear, O My people, and I will speak unto thee, O Israel, and I will testify unto thee.

If thou wilt hearken unto Me, there shall no new God be in thee, neither shalt thou worship a strange god.

For I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt; open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

But my people would not hear My voice, and Israel gave no heed to Me.

So I let them go according to their hearts' desires; they shall walk in their own ways.

If my people had hearkened unto Me, if Israel had walked in My ways,

I should soon have humbled their enemies, and laid Mine hand on them that troubled them.

The enemies of the Lord have lied unto Him, but in that age their time shall come.

And He fed them with the fat of wheat, and with honey out of the rock He satisfied them.
