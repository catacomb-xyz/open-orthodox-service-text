He that dwelleth in the help of the Most High shall abide under the shelter of the God of heaven.

He will say to the Lord, Thou art my helper and my refuge; my God, and in Him will I hope.

For He shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunters, and from every sharp word.

He shall overshadow thee with His shoulders, and under His wings shalt thou trust; His truth shall compass thee with a shield.

Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the thing that walketh in darkness, nor for the mishap and the devil at noon.

A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.

Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the reward of the wicked.

Because Thou, Lord, art my hope. Thou hast made the Most High thy refuge.

There shall no evils come upon thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.

For He shall give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.

They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.

Thou shalt tread upon the asp and basilisk, and the lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.

Because he hath set his hope in Me, therefore will I deliver him; I will shelter him, because he hath known My Name.

He shall cry unto Me, and I will hear him; I am with him in trouble, and I will deliver him, and glorify him.

With long life will I satisfy him, and show him My salvation.
