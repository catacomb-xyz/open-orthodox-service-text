The Lord is my shepherd, and I shall not want.

In a place of green pasture, there hath He made me to dwell;

He hath nurtured me beside the water of rest. He hath converted my soul; He hath led me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake.

Yea, though I walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for Thou art with me.

Thy rod and Thy staff, they have comforted me.

Thou hast prepared a table before me, in the presence of them that afflict me.

Thou hast anointed my head with oil, and like the best wine doth Thy cup inebriate me.

And Thy mercy shall pursue me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord unto length of days.
