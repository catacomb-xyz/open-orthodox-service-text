In Judea is God known; His Name is great in Israel.

And His place hath been in peace, and His dwelling place in Sion.

There brake He the power of the bow, the weapon, and the sword, and the battle.

Thou shinest wondrously from the everlasting mountains.

All the foolish of heart were troubled, they have slept their sleep, and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.

At Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, all those that mounted on horses slept.

Thou art to be feared, and who shall withstand Thee? From that time is Thy wrath.

Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven.

The earth feared, and was still, when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.

For the inward thought of man shall praise Thee, and the remnant of his inward thought shall keep a feast unto Thee.

Vow, and pay unto the Lord Thy God; all them that be round about Him shall bring presents,

Unto Him that is to be feared, and that taketh away the spirit of princes; unto Him that is to be feared among the kings of the earth.
