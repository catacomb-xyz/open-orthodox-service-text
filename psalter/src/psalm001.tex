Blessed is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of the pestilent.

But his will is in the law of the Lord, and in His law shall he meditate day and night.

And he shall be like the tree planted by the rivers of waters, that shall bring forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not fall, and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

The ungodly are not so, not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away from the face of the earth.

Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
