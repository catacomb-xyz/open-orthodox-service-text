Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord; he shall delight greatly in His commandments.

His seed shall be mighty upon earth; the generation of the upright shall be blessed.

Glory and riches shall be in his house, and his righteousness endureth for ever and ever.

Unto the upright there hath arisen light in the darkness; he is merciful, and full of compassion, and righteous.

The good man is he that is showeth compassion, and lendeth; he will order his words with discretion, for he shall not be moved for ever and ever.

The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance; he shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is ready to hope in the Lord.

His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.

He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever and ever, his horn shall be exalted in glory.

The wicked shall see it, and be angry; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away; the desire of the wicked shall perish.
