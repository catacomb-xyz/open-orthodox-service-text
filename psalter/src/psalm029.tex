I will exalt Thee, O Lord, for Thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.

O Lord my God, I cried unto Thee; and Thou hast healed me.

O Lord, Thou hast brought up my soul from hades; Thou hast delivered me from them that go down to the pit.

Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of His, and give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.

For wrath is in His anger, but in His favour is life: weeping may endure for the evening, but joy cometh in the morning.

As for me, in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.

Lord, by Thy favour Thou hast given strength unto my beauty; but Thou didst hide Thy face, and I was troubled.

I will cry to Thee, O Lord, and unto my God will I make supplication.

What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to corruption?

Shall the dust praise Thee, or shall it declare Thy truth?

The Lord heard, and had mercy upon me; the Lord is become my helper.

Thou hast turned for me my mourning into joy; Thou hast rent off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness,

To the end that my glory may sing praise to Thee, and that I be not pierced with sorrow. O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto Thee for ever.
