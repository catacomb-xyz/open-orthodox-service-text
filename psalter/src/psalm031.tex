Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sins are covered

Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose mouth there is no guile.

Because I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my crying all the day long.

For day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me; I was in misery while a thorn was stuck in me.

I acknowledged my sin, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgression, against myself, unto the Lord.
And Thou forgavest the ungodliness of my heart.

For this shall every one that is godly pray unto Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found; surely in the flood of great waters they shall not come nigh unto Him.

Thou art my hiding place from the trouble that compasseth me; deliver me, O my joy, from them that have compassed me about.

I will instruct thee and guide thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will fix Mine eyes upon thee.

Be ye not as the horse and mule, which have no understanding, whose jaws thou must hold in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.

Many are the scourges of the wicked, but he that hopeth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about.

Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous; and glory, all ye that are upright in heart.
