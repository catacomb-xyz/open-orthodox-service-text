Save me, O Lord, for there is no more a righteous man, for truth hath diminished from among the children of men.

They have spoken vanity, every one with his neighbour; with deceitful lips and with a double heart have they spoken.

The Lord cut off all deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things;

Who have said, Our tongue will we magnify, our lips are our own; who is lord over us?

For the misery of the poor, and the groaning of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord. I will set them in salvation, I shall be
revealed therein.

The words of the Lord are pure words; as silver that is fired, tried in the earth, purified seven times.

Thou shalt keep us, O Lord, and preserve us from this generation for ever.

The ungodly walk on every side; according to Thy highness hast Thou esteemed the children of men.
