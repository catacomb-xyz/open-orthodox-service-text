I will sing of mercy and judgment unto Thee, O Lord.

I will sing, and have understanding in a perfect way; when wilt Thou come unto me? I walked within my house in the innocence of my heart.

I have set no unlawful thing before mine eyes; I hated the workers of iniquities.

A froward heart cleaved not to me, and I would not know the wicked man who turned from me.

Whoso privily slandered his neighbour, him did I drive away from me.

With him that had a high look and an insatiate heart, I would not eat.

My eyes were upon the faithful of the land, that they might sit with me; the man that walked in the perfect way, he served me.

He that worketh pride dwelt not within my house; he that telleth lies prospered not in my sight.

In the morning I destroyed all the wicked of the land, that I might cut off all wicked doers from the city of the Lord.
