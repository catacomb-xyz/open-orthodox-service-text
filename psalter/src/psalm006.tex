O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.

Have mercy upon me, O God, for I am weak. O Lord, heal me, for my bones are vexed; my soul also is sore vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long?

Return, O Lord, deliver my soul; oh save me for thy mercy's sake.

For in death there is none that is mindful of thee, and in hell who shall give thee thanks?

I have laboured with my groaning; every night will I wash my bed, I will water my couch with my tears.

Mine eye is troubled because of wrath; I have waxed old
among all mine enemies.

Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.

The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord hath received my prayer.

Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed; let them be turned back, and be ashamed suddenly.
