Hear my prayer, O Lord; give ear unto my supplication in Thy truth; hear me in Thy righteousness.

And enter not into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.

For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath humbled my life to the ground.

He hath sat me in darkness, as those that have been long dead; and my spirit hath fainted within me, my heart within me is troubled.

I remembered the days of old, I meditated on all Thy works, I considered the works of Thy hands.

I stretched forth my hands unto Thee; my soul thirsteth after Thee as a thirsty land.

Hear me speedily, O Lord; my spirit hath fainted away.

Turn not Thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.

Cause me to hear Thy mercy in the morning, for in Thee have I put my trust.

Cause me to know, O Lord, the way wherein I should walk, for I have lifted up my soul unto Thee.

Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies; I have fled unto Thee for refuge. Teach me to do Thy will, for Thou art my God.

Thy good Spirit shall lead me into the land of uprightness; Thou shalt quicken me, O Lord, for Thy nameâ€™s sake.

In Thy righteousness shalt Thou bring my soul out of trouble, and of Thy mercy shalt Thou cut off mine enemies.

And Thou shalt destroy all them that afflict my soul, for I am Thy servant.
