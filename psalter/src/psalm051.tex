Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man, and in iniquity all the day long? Thy tongue hath devised unrighteousness; like a sharpened razor, thou hast wrought deceit.

Thou hast loved evil more than good, unrighteousness rather than to speak righteousness.

Thou hast loved all words of destruction, and a deceitful tongue.

Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever; He shall pluck thee out, and take thee away from thy dwelling place, and thy root out of the land of the living.

The righteous shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him, and say,

Lo, this is the man that made not God his help, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his vanity.

But I am like a fruitful olive tree in the house of the Lord; I have hoped in the mercy of God for ever and ever.

I will praise Thee for ever, because Thou hast done it; and I will wait on Thy name, for it is good before Thy saints.
