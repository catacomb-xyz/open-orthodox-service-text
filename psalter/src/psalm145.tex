Praise the Lord, O my soul. While I live will I praise the Lord; I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.

Put not your trust in princes, nor in the sons of men, in whom there is no salvation.

His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return to his earth.

In that very day shall all his thoughts perish.

Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God;

Who made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is.

Which keepeth faith for ever, which executeth judgment for the wronged, which giveth food to the hungry.

The Lord looseth the fettered; the Lord openeth the eyes of the blind; the Lord raiseth up the fallen; the Lord loveth the righteous; the Lord preserveth the strangers.

He shall take for His own the fatherless and widow, but the way of the wicked shall He destroy.

The Lord shall reign for ever; even thy God, O Sion, from generation to generation.
