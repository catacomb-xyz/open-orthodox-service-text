Praise the Lord, O my soul. I will praise the Lord in my life, I will chant unto my God for as long as I have my being.

Put not your trust in princes, in the sons of men, in whom there is no salvation.

His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return unto his earth.

In that day all his thoughts shall perish.

Blessed is he of whom the God of Jacob is his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God;

Who hath made heaven and the earth, the sea and all that is therein.

Who keepeth truth unto eternity, Who executeth judgment for the wronged, Who giveth food to the hungry.

The Lord looseth the fettered; the Lord maketh wise the blind; the Lord setteth aright the fallen; the Lord loveth the righteous; the Lord preserveth the proselytes.

He shall adopt for His own the orphan and widow, and the way of sinners shall He destroy.

The Lord shall be king unto eternity; thy God, O Sion, unto generation and generation.
