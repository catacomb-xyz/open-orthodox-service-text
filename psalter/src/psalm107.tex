O God, my heart is ready, my heart is ready; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.

Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.

I will praise Thee, O Lord, among the peoples, I will sing praises unto Thee among the nations.

For Thy mercy is great above the heavens, and Thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.

Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and Thy glory above all the earth.

That Thy beloved may be delivered, save with Thy right hand, and hear Thou me.

God hath spoken in his holy place, I will be exalted, and divide Sikim, and mete out the valley of tents.

Galaad is Mine, and Manasses is Mine; Ephraim also is the strength of My head, Judah is My king.

Moab is the cauldron of My hope, over Idumea will I stretch out My shoe; the strangers are made subject unto Me.

Who will lead me into the fortified city? Or who will lead me into Idumea?

Wilt not Thou, O God, who hast cast us off? And wilt not Thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?

Give us help from trouble, for vain is the salvation of man.

Through God shall we do mightily; and He shall bring our enemies to nought.
