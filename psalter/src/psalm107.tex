O God, my heart is ready, my heart is ready; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.

Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.

I will praise Thee, O Lord, among the peoples, I will sing praises unto Thee among the nations.

For Thy mercy is great above the heavens, and Thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.

Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and Thy glory above all the earth.

That Thy beloved may be delivered, save with Thy right hand, and hear Thou me.

God hath spoken in his holy place: I will be exalted, and divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of tents.

Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the strength of My head; Judah is My king.

Moab is the washbasin of My hope, over Edom will I stretch forth My shoe; the strangers are made subject unto Me.

Who will lead Me into the fortified city? Or who will bring Me into Edom?

Will not Thou, O God, Who hast cast us off? And wilt not Thou, O God, go out with our hosts?

Give us help from affliction, for vain is the salvation of man.

Through God shall we do mightily; and He shall bring our enemies to nought.
