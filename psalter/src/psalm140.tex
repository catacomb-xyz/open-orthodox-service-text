Lord, I have cried unto Thee, hear Thou me; give ear unto the voice of my supplication when I cry unto Thee.

Let my prayer be set forth before Thee as incense, the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice.

Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and a strong door about my lips.

Incline not my heart to evil words, to make excuse with pretexts for sins with men that work iniquity; I shall not join with their chosen.

The righteous shall chasten me with mercy, and reprove me; but let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head.

For yet is my prayer continually in the presence of their pleasures; their judges have been swallowed up against the rock.

They will hear my words, for they are sweet; as when a clod of earth is broken up upon the ground, so have their bones been scattered nigh unto hell.

But mine eyes are unto Thee, Lord, O Lord; in Thee have I hoped; take not away my soul.

Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and from the stumbling blocks of the workers of iniquity.

The wicked shall fall into their own net; I am alone, until that I pass hence.
