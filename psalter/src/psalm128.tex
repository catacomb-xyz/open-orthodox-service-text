Many a time have they fought against me from my youth, let Israel now say;

Many a time have they fought against me from my youth, and yet they have not prevailed against me.

Upon my back the wicked laboured; they prolonged their iniquity.

The Lord who is righteous hath cut asunder the necks of sinners.

Let them that hate Sion be put to shame and turned back.

Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth before it is uprooted;

Whereof the reaper filleth not his hand, nor he that gathereth sheaves his bosom.

And they that passed by have not said: The blessing of the Lord be upon you; we have blessed you in the Name of the Lord.
