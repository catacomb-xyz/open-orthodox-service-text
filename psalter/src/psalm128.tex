Many a time have they fought against me from my youth up, may Israel now say;

Many a time have they fought against me from my youth up; yet they have not prevailed against me.

The sinners wrought upon my back, they prolonged their iniquity.

The Lord is righteous; He hath cut asunder the necks of the wicked.

Let them all be ashamed and turned back that hate Sion.

Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it is uprooted.

Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, nor he that gathereth sheaves his bosom.

Neither have they which go by said, The blessing of the Lord be upon you; we have blessed you in the Name of the Lord.
