When the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion, we were like them that are comforted.

Then was our mouth was filled with gladness, and our tongue with joy.

Then shall they say among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.

The Lord hath done great things for us, and we are glad.

Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south.

They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

They went on and wept, as they cast their seed.

But they shall come again with rejoicing, bringing their sheaves with them.
