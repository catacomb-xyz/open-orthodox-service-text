Lord, my heart is not exalted, nor are mine eyes become lofty.

Neither have I walked in greatness, or in wondrous things beyond me.

If I had not been humble-minded, but had lifted up my soul, like as a child that is weaned from its mother, so wouldst Thou have done unto my soul.

Let Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth and for evermore.
