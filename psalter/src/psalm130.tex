Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor are mine eyes lofty.

Neither have I exercised myself in great matters, or in things too wonderful for me.

If I had not been humble-minded, but had exalted my soul, like a child that is weaned from its mother, so wouldest Thou have requited my soul.

Let Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth, and for ever.
