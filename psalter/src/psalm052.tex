The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and are become abominable in iniquity; there is none that doeth good.

God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, or did seek after God.

They are all gone astray; they are altogether become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

Shall not any of the workers of iniquity come to understanding, who eat up My people as they eat bread? They have not called upon the Lord.

There were they in great fear, where no fear was. For God hath scattered the bones of them that please men; they have been put to shame, because God hath despised them.

Who shall give the salvation of Israel out of Sion? When God hath turned back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
