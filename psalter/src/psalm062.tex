O God my God, early do I seek Thee. My soul hath thirsted for Thee, how many ways my flesh hath longed for Thee, in a barren and untrodden land, where no water is.

So have I appeared before Thee in the sanctuary, to see Thy power and glory.

Because Thy mercy is better than lives; my lips shall praise Thee.

So will I bless Thee while I live, and I will lift up my hands in Thy name.

Let my soul be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise Thee with joyful lips.

If I have remembered Thee upon my bed, I meditated on Thee in the morning watches.

Because Thou hast been my help; in the shelter of Thy wings will I rejoice.

My soul hath cleaved to Thee, Thy right hand hath upholden me.

But they have sought my soul in vain; they shall go into the lower parts of the earth, they shall be given over to the power of the
sword, they shall be portions for foxes.

But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by Him shall be praised, for the mouth of them that speak unjustly hath been stopped.
