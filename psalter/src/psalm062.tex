O God my God, unto Thee do I rise early at dawn. My soul hath thirsted for Thee; how my flesh hath longed for Thee in a barren and empty land where no water is.

So have I appeared before Thee in the sanctuary, to see Thy power and Thy glory.

Because Thy mercy is better than life itself; my lips shall praise Thee.

So shall I bless Thee while I live, and I will lift up my hands in Thy Name.

Let my soul be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise Thee with joyful lips.

If I remembered Thee upon my bed, at the dawn I meditated on Thee.

Because Thou hast been my help; in the shelter of Thy wings will I rejoice.

My soul hath cleaved to Thee, Thy right hand hath upholden me.

But they have sought my soul in vain; they shall go into the nethermost parts of the earth, they shall be given over to the power of the
sword; portions for foxes shall they be.

But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by Him shall be praised, for the mouth of them that speak unjustly hath been stopped.
