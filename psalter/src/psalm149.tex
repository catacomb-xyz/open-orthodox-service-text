Sing unto the Lord a new song, His praise in the congregation of the saints.

Let Israel be glad in Him that made him, and let the children of Sion rejoice in their King.

Let them praise His Name in dance; let them sing praises unto Him with timbrel and psaltery.

For the Lord taketh pleasure in His people, and He shall exalt the meek with salvation.

The saints shall boast in glory, and they shall rejoice exceedingly upon their beds.

The high praises of God shall be in their mouth, and two-edged swords shall be in their hands;

To execute vengeance among the nations, and punishments among the peoples;

To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;

To do among them the judgment that is written; this glory shall be for all His saints.
