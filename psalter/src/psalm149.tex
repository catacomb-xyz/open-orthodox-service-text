Sing unto the Lord a new song, His praise in the congregation of the saints.

Let Israel rejoice in Him that made him, and let the children of Sion be joyful in their King.

Let them praise His name in the dance; let them sing praises unto Him with the timbrel and psaltery.

For the Lord taketh pleasure in His people, and shall exalt the meek with salvation.

The saints shall be joyful in glory, and shall rejoice upon their beds.

The high praises of God shall be in their mouth, and twoedged swords in their hands;

To execute vengeance among the heathen, and punishments among the people;

To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;

To execute among them the judgment written; this glory shall be for all His saints.
