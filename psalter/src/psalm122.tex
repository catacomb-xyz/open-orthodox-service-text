Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, O Thou that dwellest in the heavens.

Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, as the eyes of a handmaiden look unto the hands of her mistress, so our eyes look unto the Lord our God, until that He have mercy upon us.

Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us, for we are utterly humiliated. Our soul hath been exceedingly filled with it; let reproach come upon those that prosper, and abasement upon the proud.
