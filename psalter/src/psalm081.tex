God standeth in the assembly of the gods, and in the midst of gods He shall judge.

How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the person of the wicked?

Judge for the orphan and the poor; do justice unto the humble and needy.

Rescue the poor and needy; deliver them out of the hand of the sinner.

They have not known, nor have they understood; in darkness they passed through. Let all the foundations of the earth be shaken.

I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you are the children of the Most High.

But ye die like men, and shall fall like one of the princes.

Arise, O God, judge the earth, for Thou shalt have an inheritance among all the nations.
