God stood in the assembly of the gods, and in their midst He shall judge gods.

How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the person of the wicked?

Judge for the fatherless and the poor; do justice unto the humble and needy.

Rescue the poor and needy; deliver him out of the hand of the sinner.

They have not known, nor understood; they walk on in darkness. Let all the foundations of the earth be moved.

I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you are the children of the Most High.

But ye die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

Arise, O God, judge the earth, for Thou shalt inherit among all nations.
