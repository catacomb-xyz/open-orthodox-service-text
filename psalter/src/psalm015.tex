Preserve me, O Lord, for in Thee have I hoped. I said unto the Lord: Thou art my God, for Thou hast no need of my goods.

To the saints that are in his land hath the Lord been wondrous; He hath wrought all His desires in them.

Their infirmities were multiplied; they hastened afterwards.

Their meetings for blood will I not convene, nor take up their names into my lips.

The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup; it is Thou that shalt restore mine inheritance to me.

The lines are fallen unto me among the best places, for mine inheritance is most excellent to me.

I will bless the Lord, who hath given me understanding; my reins also have instructed me till the night season.

I have seen the Lord always before me, because He is at my right hand, that I may not be moved.

Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also shall rest in hope.

For Thou wilt not leave my soul in hades, neither wilt Thou suffer Thy Holy One to see corruption.

Thou hast shown me the paths of life, with Thy presence shalt Thou fill me with joy; at Thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
