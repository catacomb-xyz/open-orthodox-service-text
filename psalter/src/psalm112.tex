Praise the Lord, ye servants; praise the name of the Lord.

Blessed be the name of the Lord, from this time forth, and for evermore.

From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, the Lordâ€™s name is to be praised.

The Lord is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens.

Who is like unto the Lord our God,

Who dwelleth on high, and beholdeth the things that are lowly in heaven, and in the earth?

He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill,

That He may set him with princes, even with the princes of His people.

He maketh the barren woman to dwell in a house, a mother rejoicing over children.
