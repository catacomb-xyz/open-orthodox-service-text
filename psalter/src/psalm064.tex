Unto Thee, O God, belongeth praise in Sion, and unto Thee shall the vow be performed in Jerusalem.

Hear my prayer; unto Thee shall all flesh come.

The words of transgressors have overpowered us, but Thou shalt be merciful to our ungodliness.

Blessed is he whom Thou hast chosen, and taken unto Thee; he shall dwell in Thy courts.

We shall be satisfied with the goodness of Thy house; Thy temple is holy, wonderful in righteousness.

Hear us, O God our Saviour, Thou hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea.

Who by Thy strength settest fast the mountains, being girded about with power, who troublest the depths of the sea; who shall withstand the noise of its waves?

The nations shall be troubled; they also that dwell in the uttermost parts shall be afraid at Thy signs; Thou shalt make the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.

Thou hast visited the earth and watered it plenteously; Thou hast greatly enriched it.

The river of God is full of waters; Thou hast prepared their food, for so is its preparation.

Make Thou her furrows drunk with water, multiply her fruits; when she springeth up, she shall rejoice in her showers.

Thou shalt bless the crown of the year with Thy goodness, and Thy plains shall be filled with fatness.

The mountains of the wilderness shall be enriched, and the hills shall be girded about with joy.

The rams of the flock have clothed themselves with fleece, and the valleys shall abound with corn; they shall cry aloud, yea, they shall sing hymns.
