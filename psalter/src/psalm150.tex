Praise God in His holy ones; praise Him in the firmament of His power.

Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him according to the multitude of His greatness.

Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet; praise Him with the psaltery and harp.

Praise Him with the timbrel and dance; praise Him with the stringed instrument and flute.

Praise Him with the tuneful cymbals; praise Him with the joyful cymbals. Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord.
