O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before Thee.

Let my prayer come before Thee; incline Thine ear unto my supplication.

For my soul is full of evils, and my life hath drawn nigh unto hell.

I am counted with them that go down into the pit; I am become as a man without help, free among the dead.

Like the bodies of the slain that sleep in the grave, whom Thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from Thy hand.

They have laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, and in the shadow of death.

Thy wrath is made strong over me, and Thou hast brought all Thy waves upon me.

Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; they have made me an abomination unto them.

I am delivered up, and I cannot come forth; mine eyes are grown weak by reason of poverty.

Lord, I have called daily upon Thee, I have stretched out my hands unto Thee.

Wilt Thou work wonders for the dead? Or shall physicians raise them up to praise Thee?

Shall any in the grave tell of Thy mercy, and of Thy truth in that destruction?

Shall Thy wonders be known in that dark, and Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

But unto Thee have I cried, O Lord, and in the morning shall my prayer prevent Thee.

Lord, why castest Thou off my soul, and turnest Thou away Thy face from me?

I am poor and in troubles from my youth up; yea, having been exalted, I was bowed down, and brought low unto distress.

Thy fierce wrath hath gone over me, and Thy terrors have troubled me.

They came round about me like water; all the day long they compassed me about together.

Friend and neighbour hast Thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance, because of misery.
