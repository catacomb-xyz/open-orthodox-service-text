If ye truly speak of righteousness, judge rightly, O ye sons of men.

For in your heart ye work iniquity in the earth; your hands deal unrighteousness.

From the womb, sinners were estranged; from the belly, they went astray; they have spoken lies.

Their rage is like that of the serpent; like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ears.

Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, nor to the wise enchanter.

God shall break their teeth in their mouth; the Lord hath broken the great teeth of the lions.

They shall vanish away as waters running down; He shall bend his bow until they be weakened.

Like wax that is melted, they shall be taken away; fire hath fallen upon them, and they shall not see the sun.

Before your thorns could know the briar; He shall swallow them up alive in His wrath.

The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.

And man shall say: Verily there be fruit for the righteous; verily there is a God that judgeth them upon the earth.
