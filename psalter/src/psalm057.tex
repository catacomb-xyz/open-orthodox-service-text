If ye do indeed speak righteousness, judge rightly, O ye sons of men.

Yea, in heart ye work iniquity in the earth; your hands deal unrighteousness.

Sinners are estranged from the womb; they have gone astray from the belly, they have spoken lies.

Their rage is like that of a serpent, like the asp that is deaf, and stoppeth her ears.

Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, nor of the charm of the wizard that charmeth wisely.

God shall break in pieces their teeth in their mouth; the Lord hath broken the great teeth of the lions.

They shall melt away as waters running down; He shall bend his bow until they be weakened.

Like wax that is melted, they shall be taken away; fire hath fallen upon them, and they have not seen the sun.

Before your thorns can feel the briar, He shall swallow them up living in His wrath.

The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.

And man shall say, Verily there be fruit for the righteous; verily there is a God that judgeth them upon the earth.
