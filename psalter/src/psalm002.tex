Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?

The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers took counsel together, against the Lord, and against his Christ, saying,

Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their yoke from us.

He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh at them, and the Lord shall have them in derision.

Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.

But I was established king by him upon his holy mountain of Sion, declaring the decree of the Lord.

The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.

Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine
inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.

Thou shalt shepherd them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessels.

Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, all ye judges of the earth.

Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice in him with trembling.

Embrace instruction, lest the Lord be angry, and ye perish from the righteous way, when his wrath is kindled suddenly.

Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
