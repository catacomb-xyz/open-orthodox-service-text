They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Sion; he that dwelleth in Jerusalem shall never be shaken.

The mountains are round about her; so the Lord is round about His people, from henceforth even for evermore.

For the Lord shall not suffer the rod of the wicked to rest upon the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous stretch forth their hands unto iniquities.

Do good, O Lord, unto those that are good and to them that are upright in heart.

But them that turn aside unto crooked ways, the Lord shall lead away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.
