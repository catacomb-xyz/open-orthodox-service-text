I will exalt Thee, O God my King, and I will bless Thy Name for ever, yea, for ever and ever.

Every day will I bless Thee, and I will praise Thy Name for ever, yea, for ever and ever.

Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and there is no end of His greatness.

Generation and generation shall praise Thy works, and shall declare Thy might.

They shall speak of the majesty of the glory of Thy holiness, and shall tell of Thy wondrous works.

And they shall speak of the might of Thy marvellous acts, and shall tell of Thy majesty.

They shall utter the memory of the abundance of Thy goodness, and shall rejoice in Thy righteousness.

The Lord is full of compassion, and merciful; longsuffering, and of great mercy.

The Lord is good to all, and His tender mercies are over all His works.

Let all Thy works praise Thee, O Lord, and let Thy saints bless Thee.

They shall speak of the glory of Thy kingdom, and tell of Thy dominion.

To make known to the sons of men Thy dominion, and the glorious majesty of Thy kingdom.

Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and Thy dominion endureth in every generation and generation.

The Lord is faithful in all His words, and holy in all His works.

The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.
 
The eyes of all look to Thee in hope, and Thou givest them their meat in due season.

Thou openest Thy hand, and fillest with Thy favour every living thing.

The Lord is righteous in all His ways, and holy in all His works.

The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon Him, to all that call upon Him in truth.

He will fulfil the desire of them that fear Him; He also will hear their cry, and will save them.

The Lord preserveth all them that love Him, but all the wicked will He destroy.

My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord; and let all flesh bless His holy Name for ever and ever.
