Lord, who shall abide in Thy tabernacle, and who shall dwell in Thy holy mountain?

He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh truth in his heart.

He that hath not deceived with his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour, nor taken up a reproach against those near him.

In whose eyes the evildoer is set to nought; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord.

He that sweareth to his neighbour, and forsweareth not; he that hath not lent his money out on usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent.

He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
