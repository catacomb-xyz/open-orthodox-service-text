Lord, who shall abide in Thy tabernacle, and who shall dwell in Thy holy mountain?

He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.

He that hath not deceived with his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour, nor taken up a reproach against his neighbour.

In whose eyes the evildoer is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord.

He that sweareth to his neighbour, and forsweareth not; he that hath not put his money out to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent.

He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
