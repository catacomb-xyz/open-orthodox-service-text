Behold now, what is as good or as joyous as for brethren to dwell together in unity?

It is like the oil of myrrh upon the head, that runneth down upon the beard, upon the beard of Aaron, that runneth down to the fringes of his garment;

It is like the dew of Hermon, which falleth upon the hills of Sion: for there hath the Lord commanded His blessing, and life for evermore.
