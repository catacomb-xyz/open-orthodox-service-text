Behold now, what is as good or as pleasant as for brethren to dwell together in unity?

It is like the oil of myrrh upon the head, that runneth down upon the beard, even Aaronâ€™s beard, that runneth down to the skirts of his garment;

As the dew of Hermon, that descendeth upon the mountains of Sion: for there the Lord commanded His blessing, even life for evermore.
