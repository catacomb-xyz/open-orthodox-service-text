In the Lord have I put my hope; how say ye to my soul, Flee as a sparrow to the mountains?

For lo, the wicked bent their bow, they made ready their arrows for the quiver, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.

For they have destroyed the things that Thou hast made; but what hath the righteous done?

The Lord is in His holy temple, the Lordâ€™s throne is in heaven; His eyes behold the poor, His eyelids try the children of men. The Lord trieth the righteous and the wicked; but he that loveth unrighteousness hateth his own soul.

Upon the wicked He shall rain snares; fire and brimstone and wind of tempest shall be the portion of their cup.

For the Lord is righteous, and loveth righteousness; His countenance hath beheld uprightness.
