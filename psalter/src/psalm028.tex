Bring unto the Lord, O ye sons of God, bring unto the Lord young rams; bring unto the Lord glory and honour.

Bring unto the Lord the glory due unto His name; worship the Lord in His holy court.

The voice of the Lord is upon the waters; the God of glory hath thundered, the Lord is upon many waters.

The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty.

The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars; yea, the Lord breaketh the cedars of Libanus.

And He shall break them as small as a calf of Libanus, and His beloved one is like a young unicorn.

The voice of the Lord who divideth the flame of fire.

The voice of the Lord who shaketh the wilderness; yea, the Lord shall shake the wilderness of Kaddes.

The voice of the Lord gathereth the hinds, and will discover the thickets; and in His temple doth every one speak of His glory.

The Lord dwelleth in the flood; yea, the Lord shall sit King for ever.

The Lord will give strength unto His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace.
