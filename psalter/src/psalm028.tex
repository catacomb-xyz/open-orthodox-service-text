Bring unto the Lord, O ye sons of God, bring unto the Lord young rams; bring unto the Lord glory and honour.

Bring unto the Lord the glory due unto His Name; worship the Lord in His holy court.

The voice of the Lord is upon the waters; the God of glory hath thundered, the Lord is upon many waters.

The voice of the Lord is in might; the voice of the Lord is in majesty.

The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars; yea, the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.

And He shall break them as small as a calf of Lebanon, but His beloved will be as of the offspring of the unicorn.

The voice of the Lord Who divideth the flame of fire.

The voice of the Lord Who maketh the wilderness to tremble; yea, the Lord shall shake the wilderness of Kadesh.

The voice of the Lord gathereth the harts, and shall reveal the thickets of oaks, and in His temple doth all speak of His glory.

The Lord dwelleth in the flood; yea, the Lord shall sit King for ever.

The Lord will give strength unto His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace.
