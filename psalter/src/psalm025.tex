Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in mine innocence; I have hoped also in the Lord, and shall not be weakened.

Prove me, Lord, and try me; try my reins and my heart with fire.

For Thy mercy is before mine eyes, and I have been well pleasing in Thy truth.

I have not sat with the council of vanity, neither will I go in with transgressors.

I have hated the congregation of evil doers, and will not sit with the ungodly.

I will wash mine hands in innocence, and compass Thine altar, O Lord; that I may hear the voice of Thy praise, and tell of all Thy wondrous works.

Lord, I have loved the beauty of Thy house, and the place where Thy glory dwelleth.

Destroy not my soul with the ungodly, nor my life with bloody men, in whose hands are iniquities; their right hand is full of bribes.

But as for me, I have walked in mine innocence; redeem me, O Lord, and be merciful unto me.

My foot hath stood in uprightness; in the congregations will I bless Thee, O Lord.
