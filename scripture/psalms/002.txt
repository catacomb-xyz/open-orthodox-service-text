Why have nations raged, and the peoples imagined vain things?
The kings of the earth stood by, and the rulers gathered together, against the Lord, and against his christ, saying:
Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast away their yoke from us.
He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh out at them, and the Lord shall mock them.
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and in his anger shall he trouble them.
But it is I who was established as king by him, over Sion his holy mountain, proclaiming the commandment of the Lord.
The Lord hath said unto me: thou art my son; this day have I begotten thee.
Ask of Me, and I shall give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and as thy possession the ends of the earth.
Thou shalt shepherd them with a rod of iron; thou shalt shatter them like a potter's vessels.
And now, O ye kings, understand; be learned, ye judges of the earth.
Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice in him with trembling.
Take hold of learning, lest the Lord be angry, and ye perish from the righteous way, when his wrath is kindled swiftly.
Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
