Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord shall in no wise reckon sin, nor is in his mouth guile.
Because I kept silence, my bones grew old from my crying all the day long.
For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me; I was turned to misery whilst the thorn stuck fast in me.
My lawlessness have I made known, and my sin have I not hid. I said: I shall openly tell of my lawlessness, that against me unto the Lord, and thou forgavest the ungodliness of my heart.
For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a seasonable time, but in the flood of great waters, unto him shall they not come nigh.
Thou art my refuge from the affliction which surroundeth me; deliver me, O my joy, from them that have compassed me about.
I shall cause thee to understand, and guide thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will fix mine eyes upon thee.
Be ye not as the horse and the mule, which have no understanding; with bit and bridle bind fast their jaws, who come not near unto thee.
Many are the scourges of the sinner, but mercy shall encompass him that hopeth in the Lord.
Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, O ye righteous, and glory, all ye upright in heart.
