Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose mouth there is no guile.
Because I kept silence, my bones grew old through my groaning all the day long.
For day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me; I was brought to misery by a piercing thorn.
I have acknowledged my sin, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said; Against myself will I confess my transgression unto the Lord, and so Thou forgavest the ungodliness of my heart.
For this shall every one that is godly pray unto Thee in a seasonable time; surely in the flood of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.
Thou art my refuge from the trouble which surroundeth me; deliver me, O my joy, from them that have compassed me about.
I will instruct thee and guide thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will fix Mine eyes upon thee.
Be ye not as the horse or the mule which have no understanding; whose jaws must be bound with bit and bridle, who come not near unto thee.
Many are the scourges of the wicked, but mercy shall encompass him that hopeth in the Lord.
Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, O ye righteous; and shout for joy, all ye upright in heart.
