O sing unto the Lord a new song, for the Lord hath done marvellous things; he hath saved by his right hand, and his holy arm.
The Lord hath made known his salvation; in the sight of the nations hath he revealed his righteousness.
He hath remembered his mercy to Jacob, and his truth to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
Shout with joy unto the Lord, all the earth; sing and rejoice and chant.
Sing praise unto the Lord with the harp, with the harp and the voice of a psalm; with trumpets and the sound of the ram's horn.
Shout with joy before the Lord our king; let the sea resound, and the fullness thereof; the world, and all they that dwell therein.
The rivers shall clap their hands; the mountains shall rejoice at the presence of the Lord; for he himself cometh, he himself cometh to judge the earth.
With righteousness shall he judge the world, and the peoples with uprightness.
