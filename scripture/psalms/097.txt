O sing unto the Lord a new song, for the Lord hath done marvellous things; he hath saved by his right hand, and his holy arm.
The Lord hath made known his salvation; before the nations hath he revealed his righteousness.
He hath remembered his mercy unto Jacob, and his truth unto the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
Shout with joy unto the Lord, all the earth; sing and rejoice and chant.
Sing praise unto the Lord with a harp, with a harp and the voice of a psalm.
With trumpets and the sound of a ram's horn, shout with joy before the Lord our king.
Let the sea resound, and the fullness thereof; the world, and all they that dwell therein.
Streams shall clap their hands together; the mountains shall rejoice at the presence of the Lord.
For he cometh to judge the earth; with righteousness shall he judge the world, and peoples with uprightness.
