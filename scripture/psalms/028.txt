Bring unto the Lord, O ye sons of God, bring unto the Lord sons of rams; bring unto the Lord glory and honour.
Bring unto the Lord glory for his name; worship the Lord in his holy court.
The voice of the Lord is over the waters; the God of glory thundered, the Lord is over many waters.
The voice of the Lord is in strength; the voice of the Lord is in majesty.
The voice of the Lord breaketh cedars; yea, the Lord will break the cedars of Lebanon.
And he will thin them as the calf of Lebanon, but his beloved shall be as of a son of unicorns.
The voice of the Lord divideth flames of fire.
The voice of the Lord shaketh wilderness; yea, the Lord will shake the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of the Lord prepareth harts, and shall uncover thick woods, and in his temple doth all speak glory.
The Lord will settle the flood; yea, the Lord will sit king unto the age.
The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.
