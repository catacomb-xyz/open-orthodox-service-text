Bring unto the Lord, O ye sons of God, bring unto the Lord sons of rams; bring unto the Lord glory and honour.
Bring unto the Lord the glory of his name; worship the Lord in his holy court.
The voice of the Lord is over the waters; the God of glory thundered, the Lord is over many waters.
The voice of the Lord is in strength; the voice of the Lord is in majesty.
The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars; yea, the Lord will break the cedars of Lebanon.
And he will thin them as the calf of Lebanon, but his beloved shall be as of the son of the unicorns.
The voice of the Lord divideth the flame of fire.
The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness; yea, the Lord will shake the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of the Lord gathereth the harts, and shall reveal the thickets, and in his temple doth all speak glory.
The Lord will dwell in the flood; yea, the Lord will sit king unto the ages.
The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.
