Bring unto the Lord, O ye sons of God, bring unto the Lord sons of rams; bring unto the Lord glory and honour.
Bring unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; worship the Lord in his holy court.
The voice of the Lord is over the waters; the God of glory thundered, the Lord is over many waters.
The voice of the Lord is in strength; the voice of the Lord is in majesty.
The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars; yea, the Lord shall break the cedars of Lebanon.
And he shall thin them as the calf of Lebanon, but his beloved will be as of the son of the unicorn.
The voice of the Lord divideth the flame of fire.
The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness; yea, the Lord shall shake the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of the Lord gathereth the harts, and shall reveal the thickets, and in his temple doth all speak of glory.
The Lord sitteth upon the flood; yea, the Lord shall sit king unto the ages.
The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.
