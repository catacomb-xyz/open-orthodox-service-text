Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord; in His commandments shall he greatly delight.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth; the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
Glory and riches shall be in his house, and his righteousness endureth unto the age of age.
Unto the upright there hath arisen light in the darkness; He is merciful and compassionate and righteous.
The good man is he that is showeth compassion and giveth; he will order his words with discretion, for he shall never be moved.
The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance; he shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is ready to hope in the Lord.
His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he look down upon his enemies.
He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth unto the age of age; his horn shall be lifted up in glory.
The wicked shall see and be angered; he shall gnash his teeth and melt away; the desire of the wicked shall perish.
