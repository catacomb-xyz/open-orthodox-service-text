Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord; he that shall greatly desire in his commandments.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth; the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
Glory and riches shall be in his house, and his righteousness endureth unto the age of age.
in darkness a light hath risen up for the upright; he is merciful and compassionate and righteous.
Good is the man that showeth compassion and lendeth; he shall steward his words with judgement, for unto the age he shall not be moved.
The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance; he shall not be afraid of evil tidings; ready is his heart to hope in the Lord.
His heart is established, he shall in no wise fear, until he look over his enemies.
He hath scattered, he hath given to the needy; his righteousness endureth unto the age of age; his horn shall be lifted up in glory.
The sinner shall see and be angered; he shall gnash his teeth and melt away; the desire of the sinner shall perish.
