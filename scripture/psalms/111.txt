Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord; he shall greatly delight in his commandments.
His seed shall be mighty upon the earth; a generation of upright shall be blessed.
Glory and riches shall be in his house, and his righteousness endureth unto the age of the age.
In darkness hath a light risen up for the upright; he is merciful and compassionate and righteous.
Good is the man that showeth compassion and lendeth; he shall steward his words with judgement.
For he shall not be moved unto the age; a righteous man shall be in everlasting remembrance.
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; ready is his heart to hope in the Lord.
His heart is established, he shall not fear, until he looketh out upon his enemies.
He hath scattered, he hath given to the needy; his righteousness endureth unto the age of age; his horn shall be exalted in glory.
A sinner shall see and be wroth; he shall gnash his teeth and melt away; a sinner's desire shall perish.
