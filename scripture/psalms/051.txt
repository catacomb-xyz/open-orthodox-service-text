Why dost thou pride thyself in evil, O mighty man, and in iniquity all the day long? 
Thy tongue hath devised unrighteousness; like a sharpened razor, thou hast wrought deceit.
Thou hast loved evil more than good, unrighteousness more than to speak righteousness.
Thou hast loved all the words of destruction, O thou deceitful tongue.
Therefore shall God destroy thee for ever; He shall pluck thee out, and take thee away from thy dwelling place, and thy root out of the land of the living.
The righteous shall see and fear, but they shall laugh at him and say:
Lo, this is the man that made not God his help, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his vanity.
But as for me, I am like a fruitful olive tree in the house of the Lord; I have hoped in the mercy of God for ever and ever.
I will praise Thee for ever for that Thou hast done; and I will wait on Thy Name, for it is good before Thy saints.
