Why dost thou pride thyself in evil, O mighty man? In lawlessness all the day long, thy tongue hath devised unrighteousness; like a sharpened razor, thou hast wrought deceit.
Thou hast loved evil more than good, unrighteousness more than to speak righteousness.
Thou hast loved all the words of drowning, O thou deceitful tongue.
Therefore God shall bring thee down for ever; he shall pluck thee out, and take thee away from thy dwelling place, and thy root out of the land of the living.
The righteous shall see and be afraid, but they themselves shall laugh at him and say:
Lo, this is the man that made not God his help, but hoped in the abundance of his wealth, and strengthened himself in his vanity.
But as for me, I am like a fruitful olive tree in the house of the Lord; I have hoped in the mercy of God unto the age, and unto the age of the age.
I will confess thee unto the age for what thou hast done, and I will wait on thy name, for it is good before thy saints.
