Why dost thou boast in evil, O mighty man? In iniquity all the day long, thy tongue hath devised unrighteousness; like a sharpened razor, thou hast wrought deceit.
Thou hast loved evil more than good, unrighteousness more than speaking righteousness.
Thou hast loved all the words of drowning, O thou deceitful tongue.
Therefore God shall bring thee down for ever; he shall pull thee out, and take thee away from thy dwelling place, and thy root out of the land of the living.
The righteous shall see and be afraid, and shall laugh at him and say,
Behold, the man that made not God his helper, but hoped in the abundance of his wealth, and took power in his vanity.
But as for me, I am like a fruitful olive tree in the house of God; I have hoped in the mercy of God unto the age, and unto the age of the age.
I shall confess thee unto the age, for what thou hast done, and I shall wait on thy name, for it is good before thy saints.
