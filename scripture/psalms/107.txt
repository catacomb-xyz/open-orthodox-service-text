Ready is my heart, O God, ready is my heart; I shall sing and chant in my glory.
Awake, O my glory; awake, O psaltery and harp; I myself will awake at dawn.
I shall confess thee among the people, O Lord, I shall sing praises unto thee among the nations.
For thy mercy is great above the heavens, and unto the clouds is thy truth.
Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God, and thy glory over all the earth.
That thy beloved may be delivered; save thou with thy right hand and hearken unto me.
God hath spoken in his holy place, I will be exalted, and divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of tents.
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the support of my head; Judah is my king.
Moab is the cauldron of my hope, over Edom will I cast my sandal; foreign tribes are made subject unto me.
Who shall lead me into the fortified city? Or who shall guide me as far as Edom?
Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? And wilt not thou, O God, go out with our hosts?
Give us help from affliction, for vain is the salvation of man.
In God shall we work power, and he will bring to nought our enemies.
