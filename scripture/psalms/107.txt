Ready is my heart, O God, ready is my heart; I will sing and chant in my glory.
Awake, O my glory; awake, O psaltery and harp; I myself will awake at dawn.
I will confess Thee among the peoples, O Lord, I will sing praises unto Thee among the nations.
For Thy mercy is great above the heavens, and Thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.
Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God, and Thy glory over all the earth.
That Thy beloved may be delivered; save with Thy right hand and hearken unto me.
God hath spoken in His sanctuary: I will be exalted, and divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of tents.
Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the defense of My head; Judah is My king.
Moab is the washbasin of My hope, over Edom will I stretch forth My shoe; strangers are made subject unto Me.
Who will lead Me into the fortified city? Or who will guide me as far as Edom?
Will not Thou, O God, Who hast cast us off? And wilt not Thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
Give us help from affliction, for vain is the salvation of man.
Through God shall we shall work mighty deeds, and He shall bring our enemies to nought.
