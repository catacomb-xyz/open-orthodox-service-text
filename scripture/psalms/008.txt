O Lord, our Lord, how wonderful is thy name in all the earth, for thy majesty hath been lifted high above the heavens.
Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise, because of thine enemies, to destroy the enemy and avenger.
For I shall behold the heavens, the works of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast founded.
What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels; thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, and hast made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands.
Thou hast put all things under his feet, sheep and all cattle, yea, and the beasts of the field;
The birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, they that passeth through the paths of the seas.
O Lord, our Lord, how wonderful is thy name in all the earth.
