Save me, O Lord, for a holy one hath come to an end, for truths have diminished from among the sons of men.
Vain things hath each man spoken to his neighbour; deceitful lips are in his heart, and in his heart hath he spoken evils.
May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things;
Who have said: We will magnify our tongue, our lips are our own; who is lord of us?
By reason of the misery of the poor, and the groaning of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord. I will set them in salvation; I will speak openly therein.
The words of the Lord are pure words; silver tried by fire, proved in the earth, cleansed seven times.
Thou, O Lord, shalt keep us, and preserve us, from this generation, and unto the age.
The ungodly walk on every side; according to thy highness hast thou esteemed the sons of men.
