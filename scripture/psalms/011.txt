Save me, O Lord, for the holy one hath failed, for truths have diminished from the sons of men.
Vanities hath every man spoken to his neighbour; deceitful lips are in the heart, and in the heart he spake evils.
May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things;
Who have said: We will magnify our tongue, our lips are our own; who is lord of us?
By reason of the misery of the poor, and the groaning of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord. I will appoint in salvation; I will speak openly by him.
The words of the Lord are pure words; silver tried by fire, proved in the earth, cleansed seven times.
Thou, O Lord, shalt keep us, and preserve us, from this generation, and unto the age.
The ungodly walk on every side; according to thy highness hast thou esteemed the sons of men.
