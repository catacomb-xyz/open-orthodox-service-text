I will love Thee, O Lord, my strength. The Lord is my foundation, and my refuge, and my deliverer.
My God is my helper, and in Him will I hope; my defender, and the horn of my salvation, and my protector.
With praise I will call upon the Name of the Lord; so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
The sorrows of death compassed me, and the torrents of ungodliness troubled me.
The sorrows of hades compassed me about; the snares of death overtook me.
And in mine affliction I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God.
He heard my voice out of His holy temple, and my cry before Him shall enter even into His ears.
The earth shook and trembled; the very foundations of the mountains were troubled and shaken, for God was angry with them.
There went up smoke in His wrath, and fire from His countenance set all aflame; coals were kindled by it.
He bowed the heavens and came down, and thick darkness was under His feet.
He ascended upon the cherubim and did fly; yea, He came flying upon the wings of the wind.
He made darkness His secret place, His tabernacle round about Him, dark water in the clouds of the air.
From the brightness that was before Him, the clouds passed through, with hailstones and coals of fire.
And the Lord thundered out from heaven, and the Most High gave forth His voice.
Yea, He sent forth His arrows, and scattered them, and He multiplied lightnings, and confounded them.
Then the springs of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were revealed at Thy rebuke, O Lord, at the breath of the spirit of Thy wrath.
He sent from on high, and took me; He received me out of many waters.
He will deliver me from my mighty enemies and from them that hate me, for they are stronger than I.
They overtook me in the day of my trouble, but the Lord was my support.
He led me forth into a spacious place; He will deliver me, because He delighted in me.
And the Lord will reward me according to my righteousness, and according to the purity of my hands will He recompense me.
For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not forsaken my God.
For all His judgments are before me, and His statutes have not departed from me.
I will be blameless with Him, and I shall keep myself from mine iniquity.
And the Lord will reward me according to my righteousness, and according to the purity of my hands before His eyes.
With the holy Thou wilt be holy, and with the innocent man Thou wilt be innocent, and with the elect Thou wilt be elect, and with the perverse Thou wilt deal perversely.
For Thou wilt save the humble people, and bring down the eyes of the proud.
For Thou shalt light my lamp, O Lord my God; Thou shalt make my darkness to be light.
For by Thee shall I be delivered from a place of trial, and by my God shall I go over a wall.
As for my God, His way is blameless; the words of the Lord have been tried in fire; He is the defender of all those that hope in Him.
For who is god save the Lord? And who is god save our God?
It is God that hath girded me with strength and made my way blameless.
That maketh my feet like that of the hart, and setteth me upon high places.
That teacheth my hands to war; and hath made mine arms as a brazen bow.
Thou hast given me the shield of salvation, and Thy right hand hath upholden me.
And Thine instruction hath corrected me unto the end; Thine instruction it is that shall teach me.
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not grow weak.
I shall pursue mine enemies, and overtake them; neither shall I turn again until they be consumed.
I shall afflict them, and they shall not be able to rise; they shall fall under my feet.
For Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; Thou hast subdued under me them that rose up against me.
Thou hast made mine enemies turn their backs before me, and hast destroyed them that hated me.
They cried, but there was none to save them; even unto the Lord, but He answered them not.
Then I will crush them small as the dust before the face of the wind; I will trample them down as the dirt in the streets.
Deliver me from the strife of the people; Thou shalt make me the head of the nations.
A people whom I knew not hath served me; at the hearing of the ear they obeyed me.
But the children of strangers hath proven false unto Me, the children of strangers have grown old, and halted from their paths.
The Lord liveth, and blessed be my God; let the God of my salvation be exalted.
It is God that avengeth me, and hath subdued the people under me; He delivereth me from enemies inclined to anger.
Yea, from those that rise up against me Thou wilt lift me up; from the unrighteous man Thou will deliver me.
For this cause I will give thanks unto Thee among the nations, O Lord, and sing praises unto Thy Name.
For He magnifieth the salvation of His king, and worketh mercy for David His anointed, and for his seed for evermore.
