Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous; praise is meet for the upright.
Praise the Lord with the harp; sing unto Him with the psaltery of ten strings.
Sing unto Him a new song; sing well unto Him with a joyful noise.
For the word of the Lord is upright, and all His works are in faithfulness.
The Lord loveth mercy and judgement; the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.
By the word of the Lord were the heavens established, and all their might by the spirit of His mouth.
He gathereth the waters of the sea together as in a wineskin; He layeth up the depths in storehouses.
Let all the earth fear the Lord, and let all the inhabitants of the world be shaken before Him.
For He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created.
The Lord scattereth the counsels of the nations, He setteth aside the devices of the peoples, and bringeth the counsels of rulers to nought.
But the counsel of the Lord standeth for ever, the thoughts of His heart to all generations.
Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, the people whom He hath chosen for His own inheritance.
The Lord looked upon from heaven; He beholdeth all the sons of men.
From the habitation that He hath prepared, He looked upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
He alone fashioneth their hearts; He considereth all their works.
A king is not saved by the multitude of his army, and a mighty man is not delivered by the greatness of his strength.
Vain is a horse for salvation, neither shall it be saved in the abundance of its power.
Behold, the eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear Him, upon them that hope in His mercy.
To deliver their souls from death, and to nourish them in famine.
Our soul shall wait for the Lord, for He is our help and our shield.
For our heart shall be glad in Him, and we have hoped in His holy Name.
Let Thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have hoped in Thee.
