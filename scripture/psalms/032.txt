Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous; praise is meet for the upright.
Confess unto the Lord with the harp; with the psaltery of ten strings make music unto him.
Sing unto him a new song; sing well unto him with a joyful noise.
For the word of the Lord is upright, and all his works are in faithfulness.
The Lord loveth charity and judgement; the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.
By the word of the Lord were the heavens made firm, and all their power by the spirit of his mouth.
He gathereth the waters of the sea together as in a wineskin; he layeth up the deeps in storehouses.
Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the inhabitants of the world be shaken before him.
For he spake, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created.
The Lord scattereth the counsels of the heathen, he setteth aside the reasonings of the peoples, and maketh the counsels of rulers to none effect.
But the counsel of the Lord remaineth unto the age, the thoughts of his heart to generation and generation.
Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.
From heaven the Lord looked down; He beholdeth all the sons of men.
From the habitation that he hath prepared, he hath looked down upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
He alone fashioneth their hearts; who understandeth all their works.
A king is not saved through much power, and a mighty man is not delivered by the greatness of his strength.
Vain is a horse for salvation, and by the greatness of its power it shall not be saved.
Behold, the eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy.
To deliver their souls from death, and to nourish them in famine.
Our soul shall wait for the Lord, for he is our helper and our shield.
For in him shall our heart be glad, and in his holy name have we have hoped.
Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have hoped in thee.
