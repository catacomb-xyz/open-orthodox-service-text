Lord, Thou hast been favourable unto Thy land; Thou hast turned back the captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven the iniquities of Thy people; Thou hast covered all their sins.
Thou hast made all Thy wrath to cease; Thou hast turned away from the wrath of Thine anger.
Turn us back, O God of our salvation, and turn away Thine anger from us.
Wilt Thou be angry with us for ever? Or wilt Thou draw out Thy wrath from generation to generation?
Thou shalt turn again, O God, and quicken us; and Thy people shall be glad in Thee.
Show us Thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us Thy salvation.
I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me; for He will speak peace unto His people, and to His saints, and to them that turn their heart to Him.
Surely His salvation is nigh unto them that fear Him, that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
Truth is sprung out of the earth, and righteousness hath looked down from heaven.
Yea, for the Lord will give that which is good, and our land shall yield her increase.
Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall set His footsteps in the way.
