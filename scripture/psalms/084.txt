O Lord, thou hast been well pleased with thy land; thou hast turned back the captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven the lawless deeds of thy people; thou hast covered all their sins.
Thou hast made all thy wrath to cease; thou hast turned away from the wrath of thine anger.
Turn us back, O God of our salvations, and turn away thine anger from us.
Wilt Thou be angry with us unto the ages? Or wilt thou stretch out thy wrath from generation to generation?
O God, thou hast turned back and made us to live, and thy people shall be glad in Thee.
Show us thy mercy, O Lord, and may thou give us thy salvation.
I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me; for he will speak peace unto His people, and unto his saints, and unto them that turn their heart to him.
Moreover his salvation is nigh unto them that fear Him, so that glory may dwell within our land.
Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed.
Truth hath risen from the earth, and righteousness hath looked down from heaven.
Yea, for the Lord will give that which is good, and our land shall yield her fruit.
Righteousness shall go before him, and shall set his footsteps in the way.
