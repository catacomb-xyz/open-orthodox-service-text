Remember, O Lord, David and all his meekness,
How he sware unto the Lord, and vowed unto the God of Jacob,
I shall not enter into the tent of my house; I shall not go up to the couch of my bed;
I shall not give sleep to mine eyes, nor slumber to mine eyelids, nor rest to my temples,
Until I should find a place for the Lord, a habitation for the God of Jacob.
Behold, we heard of her in Ephratha; we found her in the fields of the wood.
We shall go into his tent; we shall worship at the place where his feet have stood.
Arise, O Lord, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy sanctification.
Thy priests shall be clothed with righteousness, and thy saints shall rejoice.
For thy servant David's sake, turn not away the face of thy christ.
The Lord hath sworn in truth unto David, and will not despise it,
From the fruit of thy womb will I set upon thy throne,
If thy sons should keep my covenant, and these my testimonies which I shall teach them,
Their sons shall also sit upon thy throne until the age.
For the Lord hath chosen Sion; he hath chosen her for his habitation.
This is my rest unto age of age; here will I dwell, for I have chosen her.
I will abundantly bless her provision, I will satisfy her poor with bread.
Her priests will I clothe with salvation, and her saints shall rejoice with rejoicing.
There will I make to spring forth a horn for David; I have prepared a lamp for my christ.
His enemies will I clothe with shame, but upon him shall my sanctification flourish.
