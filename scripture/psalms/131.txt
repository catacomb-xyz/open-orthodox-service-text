Remember, O Lord, David and all his meekness,
How he sware unto the Lord, and vowed unto the God of Jacob:
Surely I will not come into the dwelling of my house, nor go up to the couch of my bed;
I will not give sleep to mine eyes, nor slumber to mine eyelids, nor rest to my temples,
Until I should find a place for the Lord, a habitation for the God of Jacob.
Lo, we heard of her in Ephratha; we found her in the fields of the wood.
We will go into his tabernacles; we will worship at the place where his feet have stood.
Arise, O Lord, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy holiness.
Thy priests shall be clothed with righteousness, and thy saints shall rejoice.
For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thy christ.
The Lord hath sworn in truth unto David, and will not set it at nought:
Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne,
If thy sons should keep my covenant, and these my witnesses which I shall teach them,
Their sons shall also sit upon thy throne until the age.
For the Lord hath chosen Sion; he hath chosen her for his habitation.
This is my rest unto age of age; here will I dwell, for I have chosen her.
I will abundantly bless her provision, I will satisfy her poor with bread.
Her priests will I clothe with salvation, and her saints shall rejoice with exceeding great joy.
There will I make to spring forth a horn for David; I have prepared a lamp for my christ.
His enemies will I clothe with shame, but upon him shall my holiness flourish.
