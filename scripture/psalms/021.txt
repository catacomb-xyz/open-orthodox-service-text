O God my God, attend unto me; why hast Thou forsaken me? The words of my transgressions are far from my salvation.
O my God, I shall cry in the daytime, and thou wilt not hear; and in the night season, and it shall not be foolishness for me.
But thou dwellest in the holy place, the praise of Israel. Our fathers hath hoped in thee; they hoped, and thou didst deliver them.
They cried unto thee, and were delivered; they hoped in thee, and were not put to shame.
But I am a worm, and no man; the reproach of men, and the contempt of the people.
All they that saw me laughed me to scorn; they spake with their lips; they shook their head.
He hoped in the Lord, let him deliver him; let him save him, for he desireth him.
For thou art he that took me out of the womb; my hope from my mother's breasts. I was cast upon thee from the womb; from my mother's womb thou art my God.
Be not far from me, for trouble is near, for there is none to help me.
Many young bulls have compassed me about; fat bulls have surrounded me.
They have opened their mouths against me, as a ravening and roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones were scattered; my heart is become like wax melting in the midst of my belly.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue hath cleaved to my throat, and thou hast brought me down into the dust of death.
For many dogs have compassed me, and the assembly of the wicked have surrounded me.
They have digged my hands and my feet, they numbered all my bones, and they watched and gazed upon me.
They have parted my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.
But thou, O Lord, keep not thy help far off from me; attend unto my help.
Deliver my soul from the sword, and mine only begotten from the hand of the dog.
Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my lowliness from the horns of unicorns.
I shall tell thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the church I shall hymn thee.
O ye that fear the Lord, praise Him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him. Let all the seed of Israel fear him.
For He hath not despised nor loathed the supplication of the poor, nor turned his face away from me, and when I cried unto him, he heard me.
From thee is my praise in the great church; I shall pay my vows before them that fear thee.
The poor shall eat and be filled, and they that seek him shall praise the Lord; their hearts shall live unto the age of the age.
All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord, and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before him.
For the kingdom is the Lord's, and he himself is governor of the nations.
All they that prosper upon earth have eaten and have worshiped; all they that go down to the earth shall bow down before him.
But my soul liveth for Him, and my seed shall serve him.
The coming generation shall be declared unto the Lord, and they shall declare his righteousness unto a people to be born, whom the Lord hath made.
