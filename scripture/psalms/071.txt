O God, give thy judgment to the king, and thy righteousness unto the son of the king.
That he may judge thy people in righteousness, and thy poor in judgment.
Let the mountains take up peace for thy people, and the hills righteousness.
He shall judge the poor of the people, and shall save the sons of the needy, and shall humble the false accuser.
He shall endure as long as the sun, and before the moon, for generations of generations.
He shall come down as rain upon a fleece; like drops of water falling upon the earth.
In his days shall righteousness rise up, and a multitude of peace, until the moon be taken away.
He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the rivers unto the ends of the earth.
Before him shall the Ethiopians fall down, and his enemies shall lick the dust.
Kings of Tharsis and of the isles shall bring gifts; kings of Arabians and Saba shall present offerings.
Yea, all the kings of the earth shall worship him; all nations shall serve him.
For he hath delivered the poor from the oppressor, and the needy, for whom hath no helper.
He shall spare the beggar and poor, and the souls of the needy he shall save.
From usury and injustice shall he redeem their souls, and his name shall be honoured before them.
He shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Arabia, and they shall pray for Him for ever; all the day shall they bless him.
He shall be a support on the earth upon the tops of the mountains; his fruit shall be raised above Lebanon, and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
His name shall be blessed unto the age; his name endureth before the sun, and all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed in him; all nations shall call him blessed.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who alone doeth wonders.
And blessed be the name of his glory unto the age, and unto the age of age.
And all the earth shall be filled with His glory. So be it. So be it.
