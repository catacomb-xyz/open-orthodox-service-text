O God, give thy judgment to the king, and thy righteousness to the son of the king.
That he may judge thy people in righteousness, and thy poor in judgment.
Let the mountains take up peace to thy people, and the hills in righteousness.
He shall judge the poor of the people, and shall save the sons of the needy, and shall humble a false accuser.
He shall endure along with the sun, and before the moon, for generations of generations.
He shall come down as rain upon the fleece, and like drops of water falling upon the earth.
In his days shall arise righteousness and a multitude of peace, until the moon be taken away.
And he shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from rivers unto the ends of the earth.
Before him Ethiopians shall fall down, and his enemies shall lick the dust.
Kings of Tharsis and the isles shall bring gifts; kings of Arabians and Saba shall draw near with offerings.
Yea, all the kings of the earth shall worship him; all the nations shall serve him.
For he hath delivered a poor man from a mighty ruler, and him in need whom hath no helper.
He shall spare a man poor and needy, and shall save souls of in need.
From usury and injustice shall he redeem their souls, and his name shall be honoured before them.
He shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Arabia, and they shall pray for him at all times; all the day long shall they bless him.
He shall be a support on the earth upon the tops of the mountains; his fruit shall be raised above Lebanon, and from the city they shall flourish like grass of the earth.
Let his name be blessed unto the age; his name shall endure beyond the sun, and all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed in him; all the nations shall call him blessed.
Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who alone doeth wonders,
And blessed be the name of his glory unto the age, and unto the age of age;
All the earth shall be filled with his glory; so be it, so be it.
