Hear, O God, my voice, when I make supplication unto thee; from fear of the enemy deliver my soul.
Shelter me from the concourse of them that do evil, from the multitude of the workers of iniquity.
They have sharpened their tongue like a sword, they have bent their bow as a bitter deed,
To shoot in secret at the blameless one; suddenly shall they shoot at him, and shall not be afraid.
They have strengthened themselves with a wicked word; they talked so as to hide snares, having said: Who shall see them?
They have searched out wickedness; in searching out they failed in their search.
A man shall draw near, and the heart is deep, and God shall be exalted.
The dart of children became their blows, and their tongues became weak upon them.
All that saw them were troubled, and every man was afraid.
And they proclaimed the works of God, and his deeds they understood.
The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and shall hope in him, and all the upright in heart shall be praised.
