Hearken unto my prayer, O God, when I make supplication unto Thee; deliver my soul from fear of the enemy.
Shelter me from the council of the wicked, from the multitude of the workers of iniquity.
They have sharpened their tongue like a sword, they have bent their bow as a bitter deed,
That they may shoot in secret at the blameless one; suddenly will they shoot at him, and will not be afraid.
They have strengthened themselves with a wicked word; they took council to hide snares in secret, saying: Who shall see them?
They have searched out wickedness; they have come to an end, searching with iniquity.
A man shall draw near, and the heart is deep, and God shall be exalted.
An arrow of children became their blows, and their tongues were made weak against them.
All they that beheld them were troubled, and every man was afraid.
And they proclaimed the works of God, and His deeds they understood.
The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and shall hope in Him, and all the upright in heart shall be praised.
