Hear, O God, my voice, when I make supplication unto thee; deliver my soul from gear of an enemy.
Shelter me from a concourse of them that do evil, from a multitude of those who work iniquity.
They have sharpened their tongue like a sword, they have bent their bow as a bitter deed,
To shoot in secret at a blameless one; suddenly shall they shoot at him, and shall not be afraid.
They have strengthened themselves with a wicked word; they talked so as to hide snares, having said, Who shall see them?
They have searched out wickedness; in searching out they failed in their search; a man shall draw near, and a heart is deep.
But God shall be exalted; an arrow of infants became their blows,
And their tongues became weak upon them; all who saw them were troubled,
And every man was afraid, and they declared the works of God, and his deeds they understood.
A righteous man shall be glad in the Lord, and shall hope in him, and all the upright in heart shall be praised.
