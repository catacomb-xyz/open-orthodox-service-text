God hath stood in the assembly of gods, and in the midst of them he judgeth gods.
How long will ye judge unrighteousness, and accept the faces of sinners?
Judge for the orphan and the poor; do justice unto the humble and needy.
Deliver the needy and poor; out of the hand of the sinner rescue them.
They have not known, nor have they understood; in darkness they walk. Let all the foundations of the earth be shaken.
I have said: Ye are gods, and all of you are the sons of the most High.
But ye shall die like men, and like one of the rulers shall ye fall.
Arise, O God, judge the earth, for thou shalt inherit among all the nations.
