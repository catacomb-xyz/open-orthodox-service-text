God hath stood in an assembly of gods, and in the midst of them he judgeth gods.
How long will ye judge unrighteousness, and persons of sinners recieve?
Give judgement to poor and fatherless; do justice to humble and needy.
Deliver poor and needy; from a hand of a sinner rescue them.
They have not known, nor have they understood; in darkness they walk. Let all the foundations of the earth be shaken.
I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you are sons of the most High.
But ye shall die like men, and like one of the princes shall ye fall.
Arise, O God, judge the earth, for thou shalt inherit among all the nations.
