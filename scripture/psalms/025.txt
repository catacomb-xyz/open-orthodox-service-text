Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in mine innocence; I have put my trust in the Lord, and shall not be shaken.
Prove me, O Lord, and try me; prove by fire my reins and my heart.
For Thy mercy is before mine eyes, and I have been well pleasing in Thy truth.
I have not sat with the council of vanity, neither will I go in with them that transgress the law.
I have hated the congregation of evil doers, and with the ungodly I will not sit.
I will wash mine hands in innocence and gather round Thine altar, O Lord; that I may hear the voice of Thy praise and tell of all Thy wondrous works.
O Lord, I have loved the beauty of Thy house, and the place where Thy glory dwelleth.
Destroy not my soul with the ungodly, nor my life with bloodthirsty men, in whose hands are iniquities; their right hand is full of bribes.
But as for me, I have walked in mine innocence; redeem me, O Lord, and have mercy upon me.
My foot standeth in uprightness; in the congregations will I bless Thee, O Lord.
