Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in mine innocence; I have put my trust in the Lord, and shall not be weakened.
Prove me, O Lord, and try me; prove by fire my reins and my heart.
For thy mercy is before mine eyes, and I was well pleasing in thy truth.
I have not sat with the council of vanity, and with transgressors, I shall in no wise enter.
I have hated the church of those doing evil, and with the ungodly I shall not sit.
I shall wash mine hands in innocence, and gather round thine altar, O Lord, that I may hear the voice of thy praise, and tell of all thy wonders.
O Lord, I have loved the beauty of thy house, and the place of the tent of thy glory.
Destroy not my soul with the ungodly, nor my life with bloodthirsty men, in whose hands are iniquities; their right hand is full of bribes.
But as for me, I have walked in mine innocence; redeem me, O Lord, and have mercy on me.
My foot standeth in uprightness; in the churches I shall bless thee, O Lord.
