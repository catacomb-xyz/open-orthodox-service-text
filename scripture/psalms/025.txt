Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in mine innocence; I have put my trust in the Lord, and shall not be weakened.
Prove me, O Lord, and try me; prove by fire my reins and my heart.
For thy mercy is before mine eyes, and I was well pleasing in thy truth.
I have not sat with a council of vanity, and with transgressors, I will not enter.
I have hated the church of evil doers, and will not sit with the ungodly.
I will wash my hands in innocence; so will I compass thine altar, O Lord,
That I may hear the voice of thy praise, and tell of all thy wonders.
O Lord, I have loved the beauty of thy house, and the place of the tent of thy glory.
Destroy not my soul with the ungodly, nor my life with bloodthirsty men, in whose hands are iniquities; their right hand is full of bribes.
But as for me, I have walked in mine innocence; redeem me, O Lord, and have mercy on me.
My foot standeth in uprightness; in churches will I bless thee, O Lord.
