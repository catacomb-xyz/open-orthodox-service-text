In Judah God is known; his name is great in Israel.
And His place came to be in peace, and his dwelling in Sion.
There he hath broken the power of the bow, the shield and the sword and war.
Thou dost wonderfully shine forth from the everlasting mountains.
All the foolish of heart were troubled, they have slept their sleep, and all the men of wealth have found nothing in their hands.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, all they that mounted on horses slumbered.
Thou art to be feared, and who shall withstand thee? Thenceforth is thy wrath.
From heaven thou didst cause judgment to be heard.
The earth feared, and was still, when God arose in judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
For the thought of man shall confess thee, and the remnant of his thought shall feast unto thee.
Make vows, and pay them unto the Lord our God; all they that are round about him shall bring gifts,
To him that is fearul and taketh away the spirit of rulers; fearful before the kings of the earth.
