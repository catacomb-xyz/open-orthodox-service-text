In Judah is God known; His Name is great in Israel.
And His tabernacle is in peace, and His dwelling place in Sion.
There did He break the power of the bow, the shield and the sword, and the weapons of war.
Thou dost wonderfully shine forth from the everlasting mountains.
All the foolish of heart were troubled, they have slept their sleep, and all the men of wealth have found nothing in their hands.
At Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, all those that mounted on horses slumbered.
Thou art to be feared, and who shall withstand Thee? Thenceforth is Thy wrath.
From heaven Thou didst cause judgment to be heard.
The earth feared, and was still, when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
For the thought of man shall praise Thee, and the remnant of his thought shall keep a feast unto Thee.
Make vows to the Lord thy God, and pay them; let all who are around Him bring gifts,
Unto Him that is to be feared, and that taketh away the spirit of rulers; unto Him that is to be feared beyond the kings of the earth.
