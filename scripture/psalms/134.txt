Praise ye the name of the Lord; O ye servants, praise the Lord,
Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.
Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good; sing praises unto his name, for it is good.
For the Lord hath chosen Jacob for himself, and Israel for his own possession.
For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is beyond all gods.
Whatsoever the Lord willed, he hath done in heaven and in the earth, in the seas and all the deeps.
Bringing clouds up from the ends of the earth, he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth forth the winds out of his treasuries.
Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, from man to beast.
He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt; on Pharaoh and on all his servants.
Who smote many nations, and slew mighty kings;
Sehon, king of the Amorites, and Og, the king of Bashan; and all the kingdoms of Canaan.
And He gave their lands for an inheritance, an inheritance unto Israel his people.
Thy name, O Lord, is unto the age, and thy memorial unto generation and generation.
For the Lord will judge his people, and over his servants will he be comforted.
The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the works of the hands of man.
Mouth they have, but shall not speak; eyes they have, but shall not see.
Ears they have, but shall not hear, for there is no spirit in their mouth.
Let those who make them be like unto them, and all that trusteth in them.
O house of Israel, bless ye the Lord; O house of Aaron, bless ye the Lord; O house of Levi, bless ye the Lord.
Ye that fear the Lord, bless ye the Lord.
Blessed be the Lord out of Sion, he who dwelleth in Jerusalem.
