Praise ye the Name of the Lord; O ye servants, praise the Lord,
Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.
Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good; sing praises unto His Name, for it is good.
For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto Himself, and Israel for His own possession.
For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.
Whatsoever the Lord willed, He hath done in heaven and in the earth, in the seas and all the deeps.
He causeth the clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings for the rain. He bringeth the winds out of His treasuries.
He smote the firstborn of Egypt, from man to beast.
He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt; unto Pharaoh and unto all his servants.
He smote many nations, and slew mighty kings:
Sehon, king of the Amorites, and Og, the king of Bashan; and all the kingdoms of Canaan.
And He gave their lands for an inheritance, an inheritance unto Israel His people.
Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for ever; and Thy memorial unto generation and generation.
For the Lord will judge His people, and over His servants will He be comforted.
The idols of the naitons are silver and gold, the works of the hands of man.
A mouth have they, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not.
Ears have they, but they hear not; for there is no spirit in their mouth.
Let those who make them be like unto them, and every one that trusteth in them.
O house of Israel, bless ye the Lord; O house of Aaron, bless ye the Lord: O house of Levi, bless ye the Lord.
Ye that fear the Lord, bless ye the Lord.
Blessed be the Lord out of Sion, Who dwelleth in Jerusalem.
