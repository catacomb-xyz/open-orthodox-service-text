The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad.
Clouds and darkness are round about Him; righteousness and judgment are the foundation of His throne.
Fire shall go before Him, and burn up His enemies round about.
His lightnings have shone forth throughout the world; the earth saw and was shaken.
The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the Lord of all the earth.
The heavens declared His righteousness, and all the people saw His glory.
Let all be put to shame that worship graven things, that pride themselves of their idols. Worship Him, all ye His angels.
Sion heard, and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of Thy judgments, O Lord.
For Thou art the Lord Most High over all the earth; Thou art exalted far above all gods.
Ye that love the Lord, hate evil. The Lord preserveth the souls of His saints; from the hand of sinners will He deliver them.
Light hath dawned for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous, and give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.
