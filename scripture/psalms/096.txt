The Lord is king, let the earth rejoice; let the many islands be glad.
Cloud and darkness are round about him; righteousness and judgment are the establishment of his throne.
Fire shall go before him, and shall burn around his enemies.
His lightnings have shone forth throughout the world; the earth saw and was shaken.
The mountains melted like wax from the face of the Lord, from the face of the Lord of all the earth.
The heavens have declared his righteousness, and all the peoples saw his glory.
Let all be put to shame that worship graven things, that pride themselves of their idols. Worship him, O all ye his angels.
Sion heard, and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O Lord.
For thou, O Lord, art the most high over all the earth; thou art exalted exceedingly above all gods.
Hate evil, O ye that love the Lord. The Lord preserveth the souls of His saints; from the hand of sinners will he deliver them.
Light hath risen for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous, and confess unto the remembrance of his holiness.
