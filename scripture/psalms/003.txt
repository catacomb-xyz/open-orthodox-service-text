Lord, why are they increased that trouble me? Many are they that rise up against me.
Many there be which say to my soul: There is no salvation for him in his God.
But Thou, O Lord, art my helper; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.
I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and He heard me out of His holy mountain.
I laid me down and slept; I awoke, for the Lord will help me.
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me round about.
Arise, O Lord, save me, O my God, for Thou hast smitten all who without cause are mine enemy; Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord, and Thy blessing is upon Thy people.
