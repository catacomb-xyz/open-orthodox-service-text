Lord, why are they increased that trouble me? Many are they that rise up against me.
Many there be which say to my soul: There is no salvation for him in his God.
But Thou, O Lord, art my helper; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.
With my voice I cried unto the Lord, and He heard me out of His holy mountain.
I laid me down and slept; I awoke, for the Lord will help me.
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, who round about have set themselves against me.
Arise, O Lord; save me, my God; for Thou hast struck down all who without cause are mine enemy; the teeth of sinners hast Thou broken.
Salvation belongeth unto the Lord; Thy blessing is upon Thy people.
