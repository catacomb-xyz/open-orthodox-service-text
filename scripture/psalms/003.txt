Lord, why are they multiplied that afflict me? Many are they that rise up against me.
Many are they that say unto my soul, There is no salvation for him in his God.
But Thou, O Lord, art my helper; my glory, and the lifter up of my head.
With my voice I cried unto the Lord, and he heard me out of his holy mountain.
I laid me down and slept; I awoke, for the Lord will help me.
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, who round about have set themselves against me.
Arise, O Lord; save me, my God; for thou hast struck down all who without cause are mine enemy; the teeth of sinners hast thou broken.
Salvation is of the Lord; thy blessing be upon thy people.
