Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, thou hast been magnified exceedingly.
Confession and majesty hast thou put on; who coverest thyself with light as with a garment.
Who stretchest out the heavens as a curtain; who coverest the upper chambers thereof with waters.
Who appointeth the clouds for his ascent, who walketh upon the wings of the wind.
Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.
Who hath established the earth upon its own foundation; it shall not be moved unto the age of age.
The deep like a garment is his mantle; above the mountains shall the waters stand.
At thy rebuke they shall flee; at the voice of thy thunder they shall be afraid.
The mountains rise up, and the plains sink down, unto the place which thou hast established them.
Thou appointest a bound that they shall not pass, neither return to cover the earth.
He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; between the mountains shall the waters run.
They shall give drink to all beasts of the field; the wild asses shall receive it for their thirst.
Beside them shall the birds of the heaven lodge; from the midst of the rocks shall they give voice.
He watereth the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth shall be satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
He causeth the grass to grow for cattle, and green herb for the service of men, to bring forth bread out of the earth.
And wine maketh glad the heart of man, to make his face cheerful with oil, and bread strengtheneth man's heart.
The trees of the plain shall be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon which thou hast planted.
There shall the sparrows make their nests; the house of the heron is chief among them.
The high mountains as for the harts, and the rock as a refuge for the hares.
He hath made the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth its going down.
Thou appointedst the darkness, and there was the night, wherein all the beasts of the forest shall go abroad.
Young lions roaring to seize, and to seek their food from God.
The sun ariseth, and they were gathered together, and they lay them down in their dens.
But man shall go forth unto his work, and to his labour until the evening.
How magnified are thy works, O Lord! In wisdom hast thou made them all; the earth is filled with thy creation.
So is this great and spacious sea, therein are things creeping innumerable, small living creatures and the great.
There go through the ships; there this dragon, whom thou hast made to play therein.
All things look for thee, that thou mayest give them their food in good season; when thou givest it them, they shall gather it.
When thou openest thy hand, all things shall be filled with goodness.
When thou turnest away thy face, they shall be troubled; thou shalt take away their spirit, and they shall cease, and unto their dust shall they return.
Thou shalt send forth thy Spirit, and they shall be created, and thou shalt renew the face of the earth.
Let the glory of the Lord be unto the ages; the Lord shall rejoice in his works.
Who looketh upon the earth and maketh it tremble; who toucheth the mountains and they smoke.
I will sing unto the Lord through my life, I will chant unto my God while I have my being.
Let my speech be pleasing unto him; and I myself shall rejoice in the Lord.
O that sinners would cease from the earth, and they that work iniquity, that they should be no more. Bless thou the Lord, O my soul.
