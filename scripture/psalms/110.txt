I will confess thee, O Lord, with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.
Great are the works of the Lord, sought out in all the acts of his will.
Confession and majesty are his work, and his righteousness endureth unto the ages of ages.
He hath made a remembrance of his wonders; merciful and compassionate is the Lord.
He hath given food unto them that fear him; he will be mindful unto the ages of his covenant.
He hath proclaimed unto His people the power of his works, that he may give them the inheritance of the nations.
The works of his hands are truth and judgment; faithful are all his commandments, having been established unto the ages of ages, made in truth and uprightness.
He sent forth redemption unto His people, he hath commanded His covenant unto the ages; holy and to be feared is his name.
The beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord, and good understanding have all they that do thereafter.
His praise endureth unto the ages of ages.
