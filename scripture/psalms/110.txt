I wil confess thee, O Lord, with my whole heart, in a council of upright, and in a congregation.
Great are the works of the Lord, sought out in all the acts of his will.
Confession and majesty are his work, and his righteousness endureth unto the age of the age.
He hath made a remembrance of his wonders; merciful and compassionate is the Lord.
He hath given food unto them that fear him; he will remember his covenant unto the age.
Power of his works he hath proclaimed unto his people, that he may give them inheritance of nations.
From his hands are works of truth and judgment; faithful are all his commandments, established unto the age of the age, made in truth and uprightness.
He hath sent redemption to his people, he hath commanded his covenant unto the age; holy and fearful is his name.
The beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord, and good understanding have all they that do thereafter.
His praise endureth unto the age of the age.
