Many a time have they warred against me from my youth, let Israel now say;
Many a time have they warred against me from my youth, and yet they have not prevailed against me.
The sinners conspired upon my back; they prolonged their iniquity.
But the Lord is righteous, and hath cut asunder the necks of sinners.
Let all them that hate Sion be put to shame and turned backward.
Let them be as grass upon rooftops, which withereth before it is pulled up;
Whereof no reaper filleth his hand, nor he that gathereth sheaves his bosom.
Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you; we bless you in the name of the Lord.
