I said: I will take heed to my ways, lest I sin with my tongue. I set a guard for my mouth as the sinner stood against me.
I was rendered speechless and and made low. I kept silent, even from good words, and my pain was renewed.
My heart grew hot within me, and in my mindfulness a fire was kindled. I spake with my tongue,
Make me to know mine end, O Lord, and the measure of my days, what it is, that I may know what is wanting unto me.
Behold, Thou hast made my days as a handbreadth, and my being is as nothing before Thee. Verily, every man living is altogether vanity.
Surely man walketh about like a shadow; in vain doth he trouble himself. He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not for whom he shall gather it.
And now, what is my patient endurance? Is it not the Lord? Yea, even my being is from Thee.
Deliver me from all my transgressions; Thou hast made me as a reproach unto the foolish.
I was rendered speechless, and opened not my mouth, for Thou hast made me.
Remove Thy scourges from me, for I have fainted by the strength of Thy hand.
With rebukes Thou hast chastened man for iniquity, and hast melted his soul away like a spider's web; surely every man is troubled in vain.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and my supplication; give ear unto my tears. Pass not over in silence, for I am a sojourner with Thee, sojourning in a strange land, as were all my fathers.
O spare me, that I may recover my strength, before I go hence, and should be no more.
