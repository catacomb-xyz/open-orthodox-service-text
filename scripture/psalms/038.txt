I said, I will guard my ways, that I sin not with my tongue; I set a guard for my mouth as the sinner stood against me.
I was made speechless, and was humbled. I kept silent, even from good things, and my pain was renewed.
My heart grew hot within me, and in my meditation a fire was kindled. I spake with my tongue,
Make me to know mine end, O Lord, and the measure of my days, what it is, that I may know what is wanting unto me.
Behold, thou hast made my days as a handbreadth, and my being is as nothing before thee. Verily, the whole of every man is altogether vanity.
Surely man passeth as an image, yet in vain is he troubled. He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not for whom he shall gather it.
And now, what is my patient endurance? Is it not the Lord? Yea, even my being is from thee.
From all mine iniquities deliver me; thou hast made me as a reproach unto a fool.
I was made speechless, and opened not my mouth, for it is thou that hast made me.
Remove thy scourges from me, for I have fainted by the strength of thy hand.
With rebukes for iniquity thou hast chastened man, and hast melted his soul away like a spider's web; surely every man is troubled in vain.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and my supplication; give ear unto my tears. Be thou not silent, for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner as were all my fathers.
O spare me, that I may be refreshed, before I depart and should be no more.
