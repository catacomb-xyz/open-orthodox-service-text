Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his rewards.
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thine infirmities.
Who redeemeth thy life from corruption, who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion.
Who satisfieth thy desire with good things; thy youth shall be renewed as an eagle's.
The Lord executeth deeds of mercy, and judgment unto all them that are wronged.
He hath made known his ways unto Moses, and his will unto the sons of Israel.
Compassionate and merciful is the Lord, longsuffering and plenteous in mercy.
He will not be angered unto an end, nor will he cherish wrath unto the age.
Not according to our iniquities hath he dealt with us, neither according to our sins hath he rewarded us.
For according to the height of the heaven from the earth, so hath the Lord made strong his mercy over them that fear him.
For as far as east is from west, so hath he removed our iniquities from us.
Even as a father hath compassion on his sons, so hath the Lord compassion on them that fear him.
For he hath known whereof we are made; he remembered that we are dust.
As for man, his days are as the grass; as a flower of the field, so shall he blossom forth.
For a breath has passed through him, and it shall be gone, and he shall know the place thereof no more.
But the mercy of the Lord is from the age, and until the age, upon them that fear him,
And his righteousness is upon sons of sons, upon such as keep his testament, and remember his commandments to do them.
The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heaven, and his kingdom hath dominion over all.
Bless the Lord, all ye his angels, ye mighty in strength that perform his word, to hear the voice of his words.
Bless the Lord, all ye his powers, his ministers that do his will.
Bless the Lord, all ye his works, in every place of his dominion. Bless the Lord, O my soul.
