Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me bless His holy Name.
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all that He hath done for thee.
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thine infirmities.
Who redeemeth thy life from corruption, who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion.
Who fulfilleth thy desire with good things; thy youth shall be renewed like the eagle's.
The Lord performeth deeds of mercy, and executeth judgment for all them that are wronged.
He hath made His ways known unto Moses, and His will unto the children of Israel.
The Lord is compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and plenteous in mercy, not unto the end will He be angered, neither unto eternity will He cherish wrath.
Not according to our iniquities hath He dealt with us, neither according to our sins hath He rewarded us.
For as the heaven is high above the earth, the Lord hath made His mercy to prevail over them that fear Him.
As far as the east is from the west, so far hath He removed our iniquities from us.
Like as a father hath compassion upon his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that fear Him; for He knoweth whereof we are made, He remembereth that we are dust.
As for man, his days are as the grass; as a flower of the field, so shall he blossom forth.
For when the wind hath passed over it, it shall be gone, and it will know the place thereof no more.
But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him.
And His righteousness is upon children's children, upon such as keep His testament, and remember His commandments to do them.
The Lord hath prepared His throne in heaven, and His kingdom ruleth over all.
Bless the Lord, all ye His angels, mighty in strength, that perform His word, to hearken unto the voice of His words.
Bless ye the Lord, all ye His hosts, ye ministers of His that do His will.
Bless the Lord, all ye His works, in every place of His dominion. Bless the Lord, O my soul.
