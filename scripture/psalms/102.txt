Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me bless His holy Name.
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all that He hath done for thee.
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thine infirmities.
Who redeemeth thy life from corruption, who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion.
Who satisfieth thy desire with good things; thy youth shall be renewed like the eagle's.
The Lord executeth deeds of mercy, and judgment for all them that are wronged.
He hath made known His ways unto Moses, and His will unto the children of Israel.
Compassionate and merciful is the Lord, longsuffering and of much mercy; He will not be angered unto the end, neither will He keep His wrath unto eternity.
Not according to our iniquities hath He dealt with us, neither according to our sins hath He rewarded us.
For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so hath the Lord made His mercy to prevail over them that fear Him.
As far as the east is from the west, so hath He removed far our iniquities from us.
Like as a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that fear Him; for He knoweth whereof we are made, He remembereth that we are dust.
As for man, his days are as the grass; as a flower of the field, so shall he blossom forth.
For when the wind passeth over it, then shall it be gone, and it shall know the place thereof no more.
But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him,
And His righteousness is upon children's children, upon such as keep His testament, and remember His commandments to do them.
The Lord hath prepared His throne in the heavens, and His kingdom ruleth over all.
Bless the Lord, all ye his angels, ye mighty in strength that perform his word, to hear the voice of his words.
Bless ye the Lord, all ye His hosts, ye ministers of His that do His will.
Bless the Lord, all ye His works, in every place of His dominion. Bless the Lord, O my soul.
