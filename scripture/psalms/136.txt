By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept, in our remembrance of Sion.
Upon the willows in the midst thereof did we hang our instruments.
For there, they that took us captive asked us for words of song, and they that led us away asked us for a hymn, saying, Sing to us from the songs of Sion.
How should we sing the song of the Lord in a strange land?
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand be forgotten.
Let my tongue cleave to my throat, if I do not remember thee, if I should not prefer Jerusalem, as in the beginning of my gladness.
Remember, O Lord, the sons of Edom, in the day of Jerusalem, who said, Lay waste, lay waste, even to her foundations.
O wretched daughter of Babylon, happy shall he be that shall reward thee as thou hast rewarded us.
Happy shall he be, who shall seize and dash thy little ones against the rock.
