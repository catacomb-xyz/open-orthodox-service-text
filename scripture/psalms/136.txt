By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Sion.
We hanged our instruments upon the willows in the midst thereof.
For there they that had taken us captive asked us for words of a song; and they that had led us away asked us for a hymn, saying: Sing us one of the songs of Sion.
How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand be forgotten.
Let my tongue cleave to my throat if I remember thee not, if I set not Jerusalem above all others as my chief joy.
Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom, in the day of Jerusalem, who said: Lay waste, lay waste to it, even to the foundation thereof.
O wretched daughter of Babylon, blessed shall he be that shall reward thee as thou hast rewarded us.
Blessed shall he be who shall seize and dash thy little ones against the rock.
