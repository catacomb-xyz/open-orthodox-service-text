Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth.
Serve the Lord with gladness; enter his presence with exceeding great joy.
Know ye that the Lord, he is our God; it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and sheep of his pasture.
Enter into his gates with confession, into his courts with hymns; confess unto him; praise his name.
For the Lord is good; his mercy is unto the age, and his truth unto generation to generation.
