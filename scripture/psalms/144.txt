I shall exalt thee, O God my king, and I shall bless thy name unto the age, and unto the age of the age.
Every day shall I bless thee, and I shall praise thy name unto the age, and unto the age of the age.
Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, and of his greatness there is no end.
Generation and generation shall praise thy works, and shall declare thy power.
Of the majesty of the glory of thy holiness they shall speak, and shall describe thy wonders.
And the power of thy fearsome acts shall they proclaim, and shall describe thy greatness.
The remembrance of thy abundant goodness shall they pour out, and shall rejoice in thy righteousness.
Compassionate and merciful is the Lord, longsuffering and plenteous in mercy.
The Lord is gracious unto all things, and his compassions are upon all his works.
Let all thy works confess thee, O Lord, and let thy saints bless thee.
They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and tell of thy power,
To make known to the sons of men thy power, and the glory of the majesty of thy kingdom.
Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all the ages, and thy dominion is in every generation and generation; faithful is the Lord in all his words, and holy in all his works.
The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and setteth upright all that are cast down.
The eyes of all hope in thee, and thou givest them their food in due season.
Thou openest thy hand, and fillest every living thing with thy good pleasure.
Righteous is the Lord in all his ways, and holy in all his works.
The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.
He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him, and he will hear their supplication, and will save them.
The Lord preserveth all them that love him, but all the sinners he will destroy.
My mouth shall speak of praise of the Lord, and let all flesh bless his holy name unto the age, and unto the age of the age.
