I will exalt Thee, O God my King, and I will bless Thy Name unto the ages, yea, unto the ages of ages.
Every day will I bless Thee, and I will praise Thy Name unto the ages, yea, unto the ages of ages.
Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised; of His greatness there is no end.
Generation after generation shall praise Thy works, and shall declare Thy power.
Of the majesty of the glory of Thy holiness shall they speak, and shall describe Thy wonders.
And the might of Thy fearsome acts shall they proclaim, and shall describe Thy greatness.
The remembrance of Thy abundant goodness shall they pour out, and shall rejoice exceedingly in Thy righteousness.
Compassionate and merciful is the Lord, long-suffering and plenteous in mercy.
The Lord is good unto all, and His tender mercies are over all His works.
Let all Thy works give thanks to Thee, O Lord, and let Thy saints bless Thee.
They shall speak of the glory of Thy kingdom, and tell of Thy power,
To make known to the sons of men Thy power, and the glorious majesty of Thy kingdom.
Thy kingdom is a kingdom unto all the ages, and Thy dominion is in every generation and generation.
Faithful is the Lord in all His words, and holy in all His works.
The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be dashed down.
The eyes of all hope in Thee, and Thou givest them their food in due season.
Thou openest Thy hand, and fillest every living thing with Thy favour.
Righteous is the Lord in all His ways, and holy in all His works.
The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon Him, to all that call upon Him in truth.
He will do the will of them that fear Him, and He will hear their supplication, and will save them.
The Lord preserveth all them that love Him, but all the sinners He will destroy.
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord, and let all flesh bless His holy Name unto the ages, yea, unto the ages of ages.
