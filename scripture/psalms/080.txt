Rejoice in God our helper; raise a shout of joy to the God of Jacob.
Take up a psalm and offer the timbrel, the sweet sounding psaltery with the harp.
Sound the trumpet at the new moon, on the well known day of our feast.
For this is a statute for Israel, and a judgment by the God of Jacob.
He made him to be a testimony in Joseph, in his going out from the land of Egypt; a tongue he heard which he knew not.
He removed his back from burdens; his hands had served at the basket.
Thou calledst upon me in affliction, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of the tempest, I proved thee at the water of contradiction.
Hear, O My people, and I will speak unto thee, O Israel, and I will testify unto thee.
If thou wouldst hear me, there shall no new god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
For I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt; open wide thy mouth, and I will fill it.
But my people would not hear my voice, and Israel gave no heed unto me.
I sent them out according to the pursuits of their hearts; they shall walk for themselves in their own pursuits.
If my people had heard Me, if Israel had walked in my ways,
In no time would I have humbled their enemies, and upon those that afflict them, I would have laid my hand.
The enemies of the Lord have lied unto him, and their time shall be unto the age.
And he fed them from the fat of the wheat, and with honey out of the rock he satisfied them.
