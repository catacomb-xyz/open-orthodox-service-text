Bow down Thine ear, O Lord, and hearken unto me, for poor and needy am I.
Preserve my soul, for I am holy; save Thy servant, O my God, that hopeth in Thee.
Have mercy on me, O Lord, for unto Thee will I cry all the day long.
Make glad the soul of Thy servant, for unto Thee have I lifted up my soul.
For Thou, O Lord, art good and gentle, and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon Thee.
Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer, and attend unto the voice of my supplication.
In the day of mine affliction have I cried unto Thee, for Thou hast heard me.
Among the gods there is none like unto Thee, O Lord, neither are there any works like unto Thy works.
All nations whom Thou hast made shall come and worship before Thee, O Lord, and shall glorify Thy Name.
For Thou art great, and workest wonders; Thou alone art God.
Lead me in Thy way, O Lord, and I will walk in Thy truth; let my heart rejoice that I may fear Thy Name.
I will praise Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify Thy Name for evermore.
For great is Thy mercy on me, and Thou hast delivered my soul from the nethermost hades.
O God, transgressors have risen up against me, and the assembly of the mighty hath sought after my soul, and have not set Thee before them.
But Thou, O Lord my God, art compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and plenteous in mercy, and true.
Look upon me and have mercy on me; give Thy strength unto Thy servant, and save the son of Thy handmaiden.
Work in me a sign for good, and let them which hate me see and be put to shame; for Thou, O Lord, hast helped me and comforted me.
