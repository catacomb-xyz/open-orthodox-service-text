Bow down thine ear, O Lord, and hearken unto me, for I am poor and needy.
Preserve my soul, for I am holy; save thy servant, O my God, who hopeth in thee.
Have mercy on me, O Lord, for unto thee will I cry all the day long.
Make glad the soul of thy servant, for unto Thee have I lifted up my soul.
For thou, O Lord, art gracious and gentle, and full of mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer, and attend unto the voice of my supplication.
In a day of mine affliction I have cried unto thee, for thou hast heard me.
There is none among the gods like unto thee, O Lord, neither are there any works like unto thy works.
All the nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord, and shall glorify thy name.
For thou art great, and workest wonders; thou alone art God.
Lead me, O Lord, in thy way, and I shall walk in thy truth; let my heart be glad to fear Thy Name.
I shall confess thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, and I shall glorify thy name unto the age.
For great is thy mercy upon me, and thou hast delivered my soul out from nethermost hades.
O God, transgressors have risen up against me, and an assembly of mighty hath sought after my soul, and have not set thee in their sight.
But thou, O Lord my God, art compassionate and merciful, longsuffering, and full of mercy, and true.
Look upon me and have mercy on me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaiden.
Make with me a sign for good, and let them that hate me see, and be put to shame; for thou, O Lord, hast helped me, and comforted me.
