His foundations are in the holy mountains.
The Lord loveth the gates of Sion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God.
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know; behold, the foreigners, and those of Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians, these were born there.
A man shall say: Sion my mother, and, A man was born in her, and, The Most Highest Himself hath established her.
The Lord shall recount in His writings of the peoples and rulers, of them that have been born in her.
How joyous are all they that have their habitation in Thee!
