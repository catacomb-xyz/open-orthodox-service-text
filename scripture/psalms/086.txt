His foundations are in the holy mountains.
The Lord loveth the gates of Sion more than all the tents of Jacob.
Glorified things were spoken of thee, O city of God.
I shall bring thought of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me; behold, the foreigners, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians, these were born there.
A man shall say: Sion my mother, and a man was born in her, and, the most High himself hath established her.
The Lord shall give account in the writing of the peoples and rulers, even these being born in her,
As all them that be glad, dwelling in thee.
