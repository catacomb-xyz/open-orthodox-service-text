His foundations are in the holy mountains.
The Lord loveth the gates of Sion more than all the tents of Jacob.
Glorified things were spoken of thee, O city of God.
I shall bring thought of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me; behold, foreigners, and Tyre, and a people of Ethiopians, these were born there.
A man shall say, Sion my mother, and a man was born in her, and, the most High himself hath established her.
The Lord shall give account in a writing of peoples and rulers, even these being born in her.
Thus are they glad; the dwelling of all is in thee.
