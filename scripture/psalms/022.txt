The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
In a place of green pasture, there he hath made me to dwell; he hath nurtured me beside the water of rest.
He hath converted my soul; he hath led me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
Yea, though I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff, they have comforted me.
Thou hast prepared a table before me, in the presence of them that afflict me.
Thou hast anointed my head with oil, and thy cup which filleth me, how excellent it is!
And thy mercy shall pursue me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord unto length of days.
