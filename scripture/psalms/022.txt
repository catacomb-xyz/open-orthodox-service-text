The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
In a place of green pasture, there he hath made me to dwell; by a water of rest he nurtured me.
He hath converted my soul; he hath led me on paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
Yea, though I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, they have comforted me.
Thou hast prepared a table before me, in the presence of them that afflict me; thou hast anointed my head with oil, and thy cup which filleth me, how excellent it is!
And thy mercy shall pursue me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord unto length of days.
