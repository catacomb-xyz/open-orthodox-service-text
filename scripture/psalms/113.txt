When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a barbarous people,
Judah became his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.
The sea beheld and fled; Jordan was turned back.
The mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like flocks of lambs.
What was it, O sea, that thou didst flee? And thou, O Jordan, that thou wast turned back?
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams? And ye hills, like flocks of lambs?
From before the Lord the earth was shaken, from before the God of Jacob.
Who turneth the rock into pools of waters, and the sharp stone into fountains of waters.
Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy and thy truth,
Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their God?
But our God is in the heaven and in the earth; he hath done whatsoever he willed.
The idols of the nations are of silver and gold, the works of the hands of men.
A mouth have they, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not.
Ears have they, but they hear not; noses have they, but they smell not.
They have hands, but they handle not; feet have they, but they walk not; neither speak they through their throat.
Let those who make them be like unto them, and every one that trusteth in them.
The house of Israel hath hoped in the Lord; he is their help and their shield.
The house of Aaron hath hoped in the Lord; he is their help and their shield.
They that fear the Lord have hoped in the Lord; he is their help and their shield.
The Lord hath been mindful of us, and hath blessed us; he hath blessed the house of Israel; he hath blessed the house of Aaron.
He hath blessed them that fear the Lord, the small with the great.
May the Lord add unto you, unto you and your sons.
Ye are blessed of the Lord, who hath made the heaven and the earth.
The heaven of the heaven is the Lord's, but the earth he hath given to the sons of men.
The dead shall not praise thee, O Lord, neither all who go down into hades,
But we who live shall bless the Lord, from now and unto the age.
