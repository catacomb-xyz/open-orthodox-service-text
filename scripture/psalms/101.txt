O Lord, hear my prayer, and let my cry come unto thee.
Turn not thy face away from me; in whatsoever day I am afflicted, incline thine ear unto me; in whatsoever day I should call upon thee, answer me speedily.
For my days are vanished like smoke, and my bones are dried like wood for burning.
I am struck down like grass, and my heart is withered, for I forgot to eat my bread.
By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bones hath cleaved to my flesh.
I was like a pelican of the wilderness; I became like an owl in a ruined dwelling.
I kept awake without rest, and I became as a sparrow that liveth alone upon the housetop.
Mine enemies reproached me all the day, and they that praised me have sworn against me.
For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,
From the face of thy wrath and thine anger; for having lifted me up, thou didst cast me down.
My days are like a shadow that declineth, and I am withered like grass.
But thou, O Lord, shalt remain unto the age, and thy remembrance from generation to generation.
Thou shalt arise, and have mercy on Sion; for it is time that thou have mercy on her, yea, the set time is come.
For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and have pity on the dust thereof.
So the heathen shall fear thy name, O Lord, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.
For the Lord shall build up Sion, and he shall appear in his glory.
He hath regarded the prayer of the humble, and despised not their supplication.
Let this be written for another generation, and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord.
For he hath looked out from his holy height; from heaven hath the Lord looked upon the earth,
To hear the groaning of them bound with fetters, to loose the sons of them put to death,
To declare the name of the Lord in Sion, and his praise in Jerusalem.
When the people are gathered together, and the kings to serve the Lord.
He answered him in the way of his strength: the fewness of my days declare unto me.
Take me not away in the midst of my days; in generation of generations are thy years.
Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands.
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment, and as a vesture shalt thou fold them, and they shall be changed.
But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.
The sons of thy servants shall have their dwelling, and their seed shall be made upright unto the age.
