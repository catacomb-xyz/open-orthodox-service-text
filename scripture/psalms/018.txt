The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament proclaimeth the work of His hands.
Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge.
There is no speech nor language, in which their voices are not heard.
Their sound is gone out into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
He hath set His tabernacle in the sun, and as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, He will rejoice as a giant to run his course.
His going forth is from the outermost border of heaven, and his course shall come round about unto the end thereof, and there shall none be hidden from His heat.
The law of the Lord is blameless, converting souls; the testimony of the Lord is sure, giving wisdom to infants.
The statutes of the Lord are upright, gladdening the heart; the commandment of the Lord is bright, giving light unto the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring for ever and ever; the judgments of the Lord are true, and justified altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold and much precious stone; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
Yea, for Thy servant keepeth them; in keeping of them there is much reward.
Who will understand transgressions? Cleanse me from my secret sins, and from those of others spare Thy servant.
If they have not dominion over me, then shall I be blameless and cleansed from great sin,
And the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, shall be unto Thy good pleasure for ever, O Lord, my helper, and my redeemer.
