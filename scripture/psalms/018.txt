The heavens telleth of the glory of God, and the firmament maketh known the work of His hands.
Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge.
There is no speech nor language, in which their voices are not heard.
Their sound is gone out into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
He hath set his tent in the sun, and he as a bridegroom coming forth from his chamber, shall rejoice as a giant to run his course.
His going out is from the outermost border of heaven, and his course shall come round about unto the end thereof, and there shall none be hidden from His heat.
The law of the Lord is blameless, converting souls; the witness of the Lord is sure, making children wise.
The statutes of the Lord are upright, making glad the heart; the commandment of the Lord is bright, giving light unto the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring for ever and ever; the judgments of the Lord are true, and justified altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold and much precious stone; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
Yea, for Thy servant keepeth them; in keeping of them there is much reward.
Who shall understand that of trespasses? Cleanse me from my hidden things, and from strangers spare thy servant.
If they should have no dominion over me, then shall I be blameless and cleansed from great sin,
And the sayings of my mouth shall be unto thy good will, and the meditation of my heart shall be before thee for ever, O Lord, my helper, and my redeemer.
