The heavens declareth the glory of God, and the firmament proclaimeth the work of His hands.

He hath set his tent in the sun, and as a bridegroom going forth from his chamber, shall rejoice as a giant to run his course.

The law of the Lord is blameless, converting souls; the witness of the Lord is sure, making children wise.
The statutes of the Lord are upright, making glad the heart; the commandment of the Lord is bright, giving light unto the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring unto the age of the age; the judgments of the Lord are true, and justified altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold and much precious stone, and sweeter beyond honey and honeycomb.
Yea, for thy servant keepeth them; in keeping of them there is much reward.
Who shall understand transgressions? Cleanse me from my hidden things, and from strangers spare thy servant.
If they should have no dominion over me, then shall I be blameless and cleansed from great sin,
And the sayings of my mouth shall be unto thy good will, and the meditation of my heart shall be before thee for ever, O Lord, my helper and redeemer.
