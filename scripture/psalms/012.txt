How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me, even unto the end? How long wilt thou turn away thy face from me?
How long shall I lay counsels in my soul, with sorrows in my heart by day and by night?
How long shall mine enemy be lifted up over me?
Look upon me, hear me, O Lord my God; enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep unto death;
Lest mine enemy say: I have prevailed against him.
They that afflict me will rejoice if I am shaken, but I have hoped in thy mercy.
My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation; I will sing unto the Lord who hath done good unto me, and I will chant unto the name of the Lord most high.
