How long, O Lord, wilt Thou forget me? How long wilt Thou turn away Thy face from me?
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, with sorrow in my heart by day and by night?
How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
Consider and hear me, O Lord my God; lighten my eyes, lest I sleep unto death;
Lest mine enemy say: I have prevailed against him.
Those that afflict me will rejoice when I am shaken, but I have trusted in Thy mercy.
My heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation; I will sing unto the Lord Who hath dealt bountifully with me, and I will chant unto the Name of the Lord Most High.
