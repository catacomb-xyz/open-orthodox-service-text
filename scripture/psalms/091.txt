It is a good to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High.
To proclaim thy mercy in the morning, and thy truth by night, upon a psaltery of ten strings, with a song upon a harp.
For thou, O Lord, hast made me glad trough thy work, and I shall rejoice in the works of thy hands.
How magnified are thy works, O Lord; thy thoughts are made exceedingly deep,
A senseless man knoweth not, neither doth a fool understand these things.
The sinners rise up like grass, and all that work iniquity brought themselves down,
It is so that they may be utterly destroyed unto the age of the age.
But thou, O Lord, art most high unto the age.
For behold, thine enemies, O Lord, for behold, thine enemies shall perish, and all them that work iniquity shall be scattered.
But my horn shall be lifted high as that of  a unicorn, and mine old age in rich oil,
And mine eye hath looked upon mine enemies, and mine ear shall hear of wicked that rise against me.
A righteous man shall flourish as a palm tree, and shall be multiplied as a cedar of Lebanon.
Planted in the house of the Lord, in the courts of our God shall they flourish.
They shall still multiplied in rich old age, and happy shall they be,
To proclaim that the Lord our God is upright, and that there is no unrighteousness in him.
