It is a good to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto Thy Name, O Thou Most High.
To proclaim Thy mercy in the morning, and Thy truth in the night, upon a psaltery of ten strings, with a song upon the harp.
For Thou, O Lord, hast made me glad through Thy deeds, and I will rejoice in the works of Thy hands.
O Lord, how magnified are Thy works! Thy thoughts are made exceedingly deep,
A senseless man knoweth not, neither doth a fool understand these things.
When the sinners rise up as the grass, and all the workers of iniquity brought themselves down,
It was so that they would be utterly destroyed unto the ages of ages.
But Thou art most High unto the age, O Lord.
For behold, Thine enemies, O Lord, for behold, Thine enemies shall perish, and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
But my horn shall be exalted like the horn of the unicorn, and mine old age with rich oil.
Mine eye also hath looked upon mine enemies, and mine ear shall hear of the wicked that rise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree, and increase like the cedar of Lebanon.
They that are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.
They shall still increase in ripe old age, and happy shall they be,
To proclaim that the Lord our God is upright, and that there is no unrighteousness in Him.
