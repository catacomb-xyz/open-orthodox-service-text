It is a good to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto Thy Name, O Thou Most High.
To show forth Thy mercy in the morning, and Thy truth in the night, upon a psaltery of ten strings, with a song upon the harp.
For Thou, O Lord, hast made me glad through Thy deeds, and I will rejoice in the works of Thy hands.
O Lord, how great are Thy works! Thy thoughts are exceedingly deep,
A senseless man knoweth not, neither doth a fool understand these things.
When the wicked spring up as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity appeared,
It  was in order that they may be utterly destroyed for ever.
But Thou, Lord, art most High for evermore.
For lo, Thine enemies, O Lord, for lo, Thine enemies shall perish, and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
But my horn shall be exalted like the horn of the unicorn, and mine old age shall be strengthened with rich oil.
Mine eye also hath looked down upon mine enemies, and mine ear shall hear of the wicked that rise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree, and increase like the cedar of Lebanon.
They that are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.
They shall still bring forth fruit in a ripe old age, and happy shall they be,
That they may proclaim that Lord our God is upright, and that there is no unrighteousness in Him.
