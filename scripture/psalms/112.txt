Praise the Lord, O ye servants; praise ye the Name of the Lord.
Blessed be the Name of the Lord, from henceforth forth and for evermore.
From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, the Lordâ€™s Name is praised.
The Lord is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens.
Who is like the Lord our God,
Who dwelleth on high, and beholdeth the things that are lowly in heaven and on earth?
He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the wastes,
That He may set him with rulers, with the rulers of His people.
He maketh the barren woman to dwell in a house; a mother rejoicing over her children.
