Praise the Lord, O ye servants; praise ye the name of the Lord.
Blessed be the name of the Lord, from henceforth forth and unto the age.
From the risings of the sun unto the settings of the same, praise ye the name of the Lord.
The Lord is high above all nations; his glory is above the heavens.
Who is like the Lord our God?
He dwelleth on high, and beholdeth the lowly, in heaven and in the earth;
He raiseth up the poor from the earth, and lifteth the needy from the dunghill,
That he may seat him with rulers, with rulers of his people.
He maketh the barren woman to dwell in a house; a mother rejoicing over her children.
