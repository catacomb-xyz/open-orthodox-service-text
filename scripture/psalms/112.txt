Praise the Lord, O ye servants; praise ye the name of the Lord.
Blessed be the name of the Lord, from now and unto the age.
From sun risings unto settings, praise ye the name of the Lord.
The Lord is high above all nations; his glory is above the heavens.
Who is like the Lord our God? Who dwelleth on high,
Who also beholdeth the lowly, in the heaven and in the earth;
He raiseth up a poor man from the earth, and lifteth a needy man from a dunghill,
That he may seat him with rulers, with rulers of his people.
He maketh a barren woman to dwell in a house; a mother rejoicing over her children.
