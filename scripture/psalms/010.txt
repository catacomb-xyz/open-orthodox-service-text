In the Lord have I put my trust; how shall ye say unto my soul, Flee as a sparrow to the mountains?
For behold, the sinners have bent their bow, they made ready their arrows for the quiver, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
For what thou hast perfected, they themselves brought down; but the righteous, what hath he done?
The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord hath his throne in heaven; his eyes are fixed upon the poor, his eyelids search out the sons of men.
The Lord searcheth out the righteous and the ungodly, but he that loveth unrighteousness hateth his own soul.
He shall rain snares upon sinners; fire and brimstone, and wind of tempest shall be the portion of their cup.
For the Lord is righteous, and loveth righteousness; his face hath seen uprightness.
