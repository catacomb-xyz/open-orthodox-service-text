Hear, O Lord, my righteousness; attend unto my supplication. Give ear unto my prayer not from deceitful lips.
From thy presence let my judgment come forth; let mine eyes behold uprightness.
Thou hast proved mine heart, thou hast visited it in the night; thou hast tried me by fire, and unrighteousness hath not been found in me.
That my mouth might not speak the works of men, for the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways.
Perfect my footsteps in thy paths, that my steps may not be moved.
I have cried out, for thou hast heard me, O God; incline thine ear unto me, and hear my words.
Show forth thy wonderful mercies, O thou that savest them who put their hope in thee; from them that have resisted thy right hand, keep me, O Lord, as the apple of thine eye.
In the shelter of thy wings thou wilt shelter me, from the face of the ungodly which afflicted me.
Mine enemies have compassed my soul; they enclosed themselves in their fat, their mouth hath spoken pride.
Having cast me out, they now compassed me about; they have set their eyes to turn aside to the earth.
They have taken me up, as a lion ready for his hunt, and as a young lion dwelling in secret places.
Arise, O Lord, overtake them, and make them to stumble; deliver my soul from ungodly men, thy sword from the enemies of thy hand.
O Lord, from thy few, separate them from the earth in their life; yea, of thy hidden things hath their belly been filled.
They are fed with sons, and they left the remnants to their babes.
But as for me, in righteousness I shall appear before thy face; I shall be satisfied with the appearance of thy glory.
