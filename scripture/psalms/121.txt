I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord.
Our feet have stood in thy courts, O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is builded as a city, whose fellowship of her is together.
For there the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, a testimony to Israel, to confess the name of the Lord.
For there sat thrones for judgment, thrones over the house of David.
Ask then for the things which are for the peace of Jerusalem, and for the prosperity of them that love thee.
Let peace be with thy strength, and prosperity within thy stronghold towers.
For the sake of my brethren and companions, I spake peace concerning thee.
For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I have sought out good things for thee.
