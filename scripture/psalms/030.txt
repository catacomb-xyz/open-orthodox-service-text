In thee, O Lord, have I hoped; let me never be put to shame. In thy righteousness, rescue me, and deliver me.
Incline thine ear unto me, and make haste to deliver me.
Be thou unto me a protecting God, and a house of refuge to save me.
For Thou art my strength and my refuge; therefore for Thy Name's sake shalt Thou guide and nourish me.
Thou shalt bring me out of the snare that they have laid for me in secret; for Thou art my defender, O Lord.
Into Thy hands will I commend my spirit; Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.
Thou hast hated them that hold to empty vanities, but I have hoped in the Lord.
I will greatly rejoice and be glad in thy mercy, for thou hast considered my lowliness; from needs thou hast saved my soul,
And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; thou hast set my feet in a place broad.
Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am afflicted; in anger mine eye is troubled, my soul and my belly.
For my life failed in sorrow, and my years in groaning; my strength is made weak in poverty, and my bones were troubled.
I became a reproach among all mine enemies, exceedingly so to my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintances. They that did see me without fled from me.
I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind; I am become like a broken vessel.
For I have heard the slander of many, they that dwell on every side; when they took counsel together against me, they devised to take my life away.
But I hoped in Thee, O Lord; I said: Thou art my God, my lots are in Thy hands.
Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that pursue me.
Make Thy face to shine upon Thy servant; save me for Thy mercyâ€™s sake.
Let me not be put to shame, O Lord, for I have called upon Thee; let the wicked be ashamed and be brought down into hades.
Let lying lips be put to silence, those which speak iniquity with pride and contempt against the righteous.
How great is the multitude of Thy goodness, O Lord, which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee, which Thou hast wrought for them that trust in Thee before the sons of men!
Thou shalt hide them in the secret place of Thy presence from the disturbance of men; Thou shalt shelter them in Thy tabernacle from the strife of tongues.
Blessed be the Lord, for He hath magnified His mercy in the city under siege.
Yet I said in my madness: I am cast out from before Thine eyes. But Thou didst hear the voice of my prayer when I cried unto Thee.
O love ye the Lord, all ye His saints, for the Lord seeketh out truth, and repays them who bring forth the more pride.
Be of good courage, and let your heart be strengthened, all ye that hope in the Lord.
