O Lord, Thou hast proved me, and known me.
Thou knowest my sitting down and my rising up; Thou hast understood my thought afar off.
Thou hast searched out my path and my life, and hast foreseen all my ways, for there is no guile upon my tongue.
Behold, O Lord, Thou knowest all things, the last and the first; Thou hast fashioned me, and laid Thy hand upon me.
Thy knowledge is made wonderful from me; it is great, I cannot attain unto it.
Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit? And from Thy presence whither shall I flee?
If I should go up into heaven, Thou art there; if I should go down into hades, Thou art there present.
If I take up my wings at the dawn, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall Thy hand lead me, and Thy right hand shall hold me.
And I said: Surely darkness shall trample me, and yet night shall be as light in my pleasure.
For darkness will not be darkness with Thee, and night shall made to shine as day; as is the darkness thereof, even so shall be the light of it.
For Thou hast possessed my reins; O Lord, Thou hast protected me from my mother's womb.
I will confess unto Thee, for Thou art fearsome and wonderous; marvellous are Thy works, and my soul knoweth it well.
My bones are not hid from Thee, which Thou hast made in secret, nor my substance in the lowest parts of the earth.
Thine eyes did see my unformed being, and in Thy book shall all be written; for in days they shall be fashioned, and no one within them.
But to me, O Lord, Thy friends are exceedingly honoured; their rule has been greatly strengthened.
I will number them, and they shall be multiplied beyond the sand; when I awake, I am still with Thee.
Surely Thou wilt slay the sinners, O God; depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men. For quarrelsome in thoughts are they, in vain shall they take Thy cities.
Have not I hated them that hate Thee, O Lord? And have not I wasted away because of Thine enemies?
I hated them with perfect hatred; they are counted as mine enemies.
Prove me, O Lord, and know my heart; examine me and know my paths.
And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
