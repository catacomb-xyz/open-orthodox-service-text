O Lord, Thou hast proved me, and known me.
Thou knowest my sitting down and my rising up; thou hast understood my thought from afar off.
Thou hast searched out my path and my measure, and hast foreseen all my ways, for there is no guile upon my tongue.
Behold, O Lord, thou knowest all things, the last and the first; thou hast fashioned me, and laid Thy hand upon me.
Thy knowledge is made wonderful from me; it is made strong, I cannot attain unto it.
Whither shall I go from thy spirit? And from thy face whither shall I flee?
If I should go up into heaven, thou art there; if I should go down into hades, thou art there present.
If I take up my wings at dawn, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
And I said, Surely darkness shall trample me, and night shall be as light in my pleasure.
For darkness shall not be darkness with thee, and night shall made to shine as day; as is the darkness thereof, even so shall be the light of it.
For thou hast possessed my reins, O Lord; thou hast supported me from my mother's womb.
I shall confess unto thee, for thou art fearfully magnified; marvellous are thy works, and my soul knoweth it well.
My bones are not hid from thee, which thou hast made in secret, nor my substance in the lowest parts of the earth.
Thine eyes did see my unformed being, and in thy book shall all be written; for in days they shall be fashioned, and no one in them.
But to me, O Lord, thy friends are exceedingly honoured; their beginnings were exceedingly strengthened.
I shall number them, and they shall be multiplied beyond the sand; when I awake, I am still with thee.
As surely as thou wilt slay sinners, O God; depart from me therefore, O ye men of bloodshed, for ye quarrelsome in thoughts; in vain shall they take thy cities.
Have not I hated them that hate thee, O Lord? And wasted away because of thine enemies?
I hated them with a perfect hatred; they became as enemies to me.
Prove me, O God, and know my heart; examine me and know my paths,
And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
