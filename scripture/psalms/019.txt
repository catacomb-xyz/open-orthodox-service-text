May the Lord hear thee in a time of affliction; may the name of the God of Jacob protect thee.
May he send thee help from the holy place, and defend thee out of Sion.
May he remember thy every sacrifice, and fatten thy whole burnt offering.
May the Lord give unto thee according to thine own heart, and fulfill thy every counsel.
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of the Lord our God shall we be magnified; may the Lord fulfill all thy requests.
Now I know that the Lord hath saved his christ; he will hear him from his holy heaven; in mighty deeds is the salvation of his right hand.
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will be magnified in the name of the Lord our God.
They were fettered and fell, but we are risen and set upright.
O Lord, save the king, and hear us on whatsoever day we should call upon thee.
