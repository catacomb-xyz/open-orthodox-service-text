May the Lord hear Thee in the day of affliction; may the Name of the God of Jacob protect thee.
May he send thee help from the sanctuary, and defend thee out of Sion.
May He remember all Thy sacrifices, and fatten Thy whole burnt offering.
May the Lord grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsels.
We will rejoice in Thy salvation, and in the Name of the Lord our God shall we be magnified.
May the Lord fulfil all Thy petitions. Now know I that the Lord hath saved His anointed.
He will hear him from His holy heaven; in mighty deeds is the salvation of His right hand.
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we shall be made great in the Name of the Lord our God.
They are bound hand and foot, and are fallen, but we are risen and set upright.
O Lord, save the king, and hear us in the day wherein we call upon Thee.
