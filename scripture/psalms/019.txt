May the Lord hear thee in the day of affliction; may the name of the God of Jacob protect thee.
May he send thee help from the holy place, and defend thee out of Sion.
May he remember thy every sacrifice, and fatten thy whole burnt offering.
May the Lord grant unto thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil thy every counsel.
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of the Lord our God shall we be magnified.
May the Lord fulfil all thy requests. Now I know that the Lord hath saved his christ.
He will hear him from his holy heaven; in mighty deeds is the salvation of his right hand.
Some in chariots, and some in horses, but in the name of the Lord our God shall we be magnified.
As for them, they were fettered and fell, but we are risen and set upright.
O Lord, save the king, and hear us in the day wherein we call upon thee.
