The earth is the Lord's, and its fullness; the world, and all they that dwelleth therein.
He hath founded it upon seas, and prepared it upon rivers.
Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord, or who shall stand in his holy place?
He that is innocent in hands, and pure in heart; who hath not received his soul in vain, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour.
He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his Saviour.
This is the generation of them that seek the Lord, of them that seek the face of the God of Jacob.
Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting gates, and the King of glory shall enter in.
Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in war.
Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting gates; and the King of glory shall enter in.
Who is this King of glory? The Lord of powers, he is the King of glory.
