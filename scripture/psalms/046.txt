O clap your hands, all ye nations; shout unto God with a voice of great joy.
For the Lord Most High is be feared; He is a great King over all the earth.
He hath subdued peoples under us, and nations under our feet.
He hath chosen us for His inheritance, the beauty of Jacob whom He loved.
God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of the trumpet.
Sing praises to our God, sing praises; sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
For God is the King of all the earth; sing ye praises with understanding.
God reigneth over the nations; God sitteth upon His holy throne.
The rulers of the peoples are gathered together with the God of Abraham, for God's mighty ones of the earth are greatly exalted.
