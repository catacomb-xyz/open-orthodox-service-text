O clap your hands, all ye nations; raise a shout unto God with a voice of rejoicing.
For the Lord most high is terrible; a great king over all the earth.
He hath subjected peoples unto us, and nations under our feet.
For he hath chosen for us his inheritance, the beauty of Jacob whom he loved.
God is gone up with a great shout, the Lord with a sound of trumpet.
Sing praises unto our God, sing praises; sing praises unto our king, sing praises.
For God is king of all the earth; sing ye praises with understanding.
God ruleth over the nations; God sitteth upon his holy throne.
Rulers of peoples are gathered together with the God of Abraham, for the mighty ones of the earth belong to God; greatly were they raised up.
