O clap your hands, all ye nations; raise a shout unto God with a voice of rejoicing.
For the Lord most high is to be feared; a great king over all the earth.
He hath subjected peoples unto us, and nations under our feet.
For he hath chosen for us his inheritance, the beauty of Jacob whom he loved.
God hath gone up in a great shout, the Lord in the sound of the trumpet.
Sing praises unto our God, sing praises; sing praises unto our king, sing praises.
For God is king of all the earth; sing ye praises with understanding.
God ruleth over the nations; God sitteth upon his holy throne.
The rulers of the peoples are gathered together with the God of Abraham, for God's mighty ones of the earth were greatly raised up.
