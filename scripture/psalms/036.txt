Be thou not jealous of evildoers, nor envy them that work iniquity.
For they shall shortly wither like the grass, and like the green herbs shall they soon fall away.
Hope in the Lord, and do good; dwell in the land, and thou shalt be fed with the riches thereof.
Delight thyself in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires of thy heart.
Disclose thy way unto the Lord, and put thy trust in Him, and He shall bring it to pass.
And He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.
Submit thyself unto the Lord, and humbly ask of Him; be thou not jealous of him that prospereth in his way, nor of the man that worketh iniquity.
Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; be thou not jealously provoked so at to do evil.
For evildoers shall be utterly destroyed, but those that patiently wait on the Lord, they shall inherit the earth.
For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, thou shalt diligently seek out his place, and shalt not find it.
But the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
The sinner shall watch for the righteous man, and gnash his teeth against him.
But the Lord shall laugh aloud at him, for He seeth that his day will come.
The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow; to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay the upright heart.
Let their sword enter into their own heart, and let their bows be broken.
Better is the little that the righteous man hath than the many riches of the wicked.
For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but the Lord upholdeth the righteous.
The Lord knoweth the ways of the blameless, and their inheritance shall be for ever.
They shall not be put to shame in the evil time, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
For the wicked shall perish. And the enemies of the Lord, as they be glorified and lifted up, vanishing like smoke they vanished.
The wicked borroweth and will not repay; but the righteous showeth mercy and giveth.
For they that bless Him shall inherit the earth, but they that curse Him shall perish.
By the Lord are a manâ€™s steps ordered, and he shall delight in His way.
Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down, for the Lord upholdeth his hand.
I have been young, and now indeed I am old, and I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.
He showeth mercy, and lendeth all the day; his seed shall be for a blessing.
Depart from evil, and do good, and dwell for evermore.
For the Lord loveth judgment, and forsaketh not His saints; they shall be preserved for ever. But the wicked shall be banished, and the seed of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed.
The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.
The mouth of the righteous shall meditate wisdom, and his tongue shall speak of judgment.
The law of his God is in his heart; he shall not stumble in his steps.
The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
But the Lord will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when He judgeth him.
Wait on the Lord, and keep His way, and He shall lift thee up to inherit the land; when the wicked are utterly destroyed, thou shalt see it.
I have seen the ungodly highly lifted up, and raised up as the cedars of Lebanon.
Yet I passed by, and lo, he was not; yea, I sought him, but his place could not be found.
Keep innocence, and behold uprightness, for there is a remnant for the man of peace.
But the lawless shall be destroyed together; the remnant of the ungodly shall be no more.
But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord, and He is their defence in the time of tribulation.
The Lord shall help them, and deliver them; He shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they have hoped in Him.
