Preserve me, O Lord, for in Thee have I hoped. I said unto the Lord: Thou art my God, for of my goods Thou hast no need.
To the saints that are in his land hath the Lord been wondrous; He hath wrought all His desires in them.
Their infirmities were multiplied; after these they made haste.
Their meetings for blood will I not convene, nor will I take up their names into my lips.
The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup; it is Thou that shalt restore mine inheritance to me.
The measured lines are fallen unto me among the best places, for mine inheritance is most excellent to me.
I will bless the Lord, who hath given me understanding; my reins also have instructed me till the night season.
I have seen the Lord always before me, for He is at my right hand, that I should not be moved.
Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also shall dwell in hope.
For Thou wilt not leave my soul in hades, neither wilt Thou suffer Thy Holy One to see corruption.
Thou hast shown me the paths of life, with Thy countenance Thou shalt fill me with gladness; at Thy right hand are delights unto the end.
