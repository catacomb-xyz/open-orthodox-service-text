Preserve me, O Lord, for in thee have I hoped. I said unto the Lord: Thou art my God, for of my goods thou hast no need.
In the saints who are in his earth hath the Lord made wondrous; all the acts of his will are in them.
Their infirmities were multiplied; after these they made haste.
Their meetings for blood will I not convene, nor will I take up their names into my lips.
The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup; it is thou that shalt restore mine inheritance unto me.
The measured lines are fallen upon me in the most excellent, yea mine inheritance is most excellent unto to me.
I will bless the Lord, who hath given me understanding; my reins have taught me even until the night.
I foresaw the Lord ever before my face, for he is at my right hand, that I should not be moved.
Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced, and my flesh shall dwell in hope.
For thou wilt not leave my soul in hades, neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption.
Thou hast shown me the paths of life, with thy face thou shalt fill me with gladness; at thy right hand are delights unto the end.
