The Lord said unto my Lord: Sit thou at my right hand, until I set thine enemies as a footstool for thy feet.
The Lord shall send thee a rod of strength out of Sion, and rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
With thee is dominion in the day of thy power, in the splendour of thy saints.
From the womb before the morning star have I begotten thee.
The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent: thou art a priest unto the ages after the order of Melchisedek.
The Lord at thy right hand hath broken kings in the day of his wrath.
He shall judge among the nations; he shall make full with dead bodies; he shall crush the heads of many upon the earth.
Out of the torrent in the way shall he drink; therefore shall he lift up His head.
