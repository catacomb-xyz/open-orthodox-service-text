Shall not my soul be subject to God? For from Him cometh my salvation.
For He is my God, my Saviour and my helper; and I shall be moved no more.

But they made plans to cast aside mine honour, they ran in deceit; they bless with their mouth, but with their heart they curse.
But be thou subject unto God, O my soul, for He is my patient endurance.
For He only is my God, my Saviour and my helper; and I shall not be moved.
In God is my salvation and my glory; He is the God of my help, and my hope is in God.
Hope in Him, all ye congregation of people; pour out your heart before Him, for God is our helper.
For the sons of men are vain, the sons of men are liars in their measures; out of vanity they gather themselves together, that they may work wrong.
Set not your hope upon wrongdoing, and set not your desire on plunder; if riches abound, set not your heart upon them.
Once did God speak, and these two things have I heard: that power belongeth unto God, and mercy to Thee, O Lord; for Thou shalt render to every man according to his works.
