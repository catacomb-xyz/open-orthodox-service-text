A fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and are become loathsome in iniquities; there is none that doeth good.
God looked down from the heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any that did understand, or did seek after God.
They are all gone astray; they are altogether become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
Shall they not understand, all they that work iniquity, who eat up my people as they eat bread? They have not called upon the Lord; there were they in great fear, where no fear was.
For God hath scattered the bones of them that please men; they have been put to shame, for God hath brought them to nought.
Who shall give from Sion the salvation of Israel? When God turneth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
