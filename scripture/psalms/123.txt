Had it not been that the Lord was with us, let Israel now say,
Had it not been that the Lord was with us, when men rose up against us,
Then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us; then the waters would have drowned us.
Our soul would have passed through a rushing stream; yea, our soul would have passed through the overwhelming water.
Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us over as a prey to their teeth.
Our soul, like a sparrow, hath been delivered out from the snare of the hunters.
The snare was broken, and we were delivered.
Our help is in the name of the Lord, who hath made the heaven and the earth.
