All nations compassed me about, but in the Name of the Lord I repulsed them.
They compassed me about, yea, they compassed me about; but in the Name of the Lord I repulsed them.
They compassed me about, like bees around a honeycomb, and they burst into flame as fire among the thorns; but in the Name of the Lord I repulsed them.
I was thrust, and sore shaken, that I might fall; but the Lord was quick to help me.
The Lord is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.

The Lord hath chastened me sore, but He hath not given me over unto death.
Open to me the gates of righteousness; I will go into them, and I will praise the Lord.

This is the day which the Lord hath made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.
Save now, O Lord; O Lord, send now prosperity.
Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord; we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord.
The Lord is God, and hath appeared unto us; appoint a feast with thick branches, even to the horns of the altar.
Thou art my God, and I will praise Thee; Thou art my God, and I will exalt Thee.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever.
