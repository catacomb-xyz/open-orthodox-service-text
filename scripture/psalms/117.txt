O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever.
Let the house of Israel now say that He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever.
Let the house of Aaron now say that He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever.
Let all they that fear the Lord now say that He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever.
In mine affliction I called upon the Lord, and the Lord heard me into widening.
The Lord is my help, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
The Lord is my help, and I shall look down upon mine enemies.
It is better to trust in the Lord than to trust in man.
It is better to hope in the Lord than to hope in princes.
All nations compassed me about, but in the Name of the Lord have I driven them back.
Yea, they kept me on every side, but in the Name of the Lord have I driven them back.
They came about me like bees to a honeycomb, and burned even as fire among the thorns, but in the Name of the Lord have I driven them back.
Being pushed, I was overturned that I might fall; but the Lord was quick to help me.
The Lord is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.
The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the dwellings of the righteous.
The right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength, the right hand of the Lord hath lifted me up; the right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength.
I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord.
The Lord hath chastened me greatly, but He hath not given me over unto death.
Open unto me the gates of righteousness, that having gone into them, I may give  thanks unto the Lord.
This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall enter by it.
I will give thanks unto Thee, for Thou hast heard me, and Thou art become my salvation.
The stone which the builders rejected hath become the chief cornerstone.
This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.
This is the day which the Lord hath made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.
Save now, O Lord; O Lord, send now prosperity.
Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord; we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord.
God is the Lord, and hath appeared unto us; appoint a feast with the cherubim to overshadow, even to the horns of the altar.
Thou art my God, and I will give thanks unto Thee; Thou art my God, and I will lift thee up. I will give thanks unto Thee, for Thou hast heard me, and Thou art become my salvation.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever.
