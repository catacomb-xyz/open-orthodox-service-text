It is better to hope in the Lord than to hope in princes.
All nations compassed me about, but in the name of the Lord have I warded them off.
Yea, they kept me on every side, but in the name of the Lord have I warded them off.
They came round about about me like bees to a honeycomb, and burned away as a fire among thorns, but in the name of the Lord have I warded them off.
Being pushed, I was overturned that I might fall; but the Lord took hold of me.
The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation.
In the dwellings of the righteous is a voice of rejoicing and salvation; the right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength.

This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall enter by it.

A stone which the builders rejected, the same is become a head cornerstone.
This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.
This is the day which the Lord hath made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.
O Lord, save now; O Lord, send now prosperity.
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord.

O give thanks unto the Lord, that he is good, that unto the age is his mercy.
