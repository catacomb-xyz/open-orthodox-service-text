Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me; for my soul trusteth in thee; yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, until lawlessness should pass by.
I will cry unto God the most high, the God that worketh good unto me.
He hath sent forth from heaven and saved me; he gave for reproach those who trample me down.
God hath sent forth his mercy and his truth, and hath delivered my soul from the midst of lions; I laid me down to sleep as one troubled.
As for the sons of men, their teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
Be thou lifted up, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory above all the earth.
They have prepared a snare for my feet, and bowed down my soul. They have digged a pit before my face, whereof they are fallen in themselves.
Ready is my heart, O God, ready is my heart; I will sing and chant in my glory.
Awake, O my glory; awake, O psaltery and harp; I myself will awake early.
I will confess thee, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing unto thee among the nations.
For thy mercy hath been magnified unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.
Be thou lifted up above the heavens, O God, and thy glory over all the earth.
