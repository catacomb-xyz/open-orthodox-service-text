Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me; for my soul hath hoped in Thee; yea, in the shadow of Thy wings will I hope, until iniquity should pass away.
I will cry unto God the Most High, the God that doeth good unto me.
He hath sent forth from heaven and saved me; He gave for reproach those who trampled me down.
God hath sent forth His mercy and His truth, and hath delivered my soul from the midst of lions; I laid me down to sleep as one troubled.
As for the sons of men, their teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and Thy glory above all the earth.
They have prepared a snare for my feet, and bowed down my soul. They have dug a pit before my face, and they are fallen into it themselves.
Ready is my heart, O God, ready is my heart; I will sing and chant psalms with my glory.
Awake, O my glory; awake, O psaltery and harp; I myself will awake early.
I will praise Thee, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises unto Thee among the nations.
For Thy mercy is magnified unto the heavens, and Thy truth unto the clouds.
Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God, and Thy glory above all the earth.
