I will exalt Thee, O Lord, for Thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
O Lord my God, I cried unto Thee; and Thou hast healed me.
O Lord, Thou hast brought up my soul from hades; Thou hast delivered me from them that go down into the pit.
Sing unto the Lord, O ye His saints, and give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.
For wrath is in His anger, but life is in His will; weeping shall endure for the night, but joy cometh in the morning.
And in my prosperity I said: I shall never be moved.
Lord, by Thy will Thou hast given strength unto my beauty; but Thou didst turn Thy face from me, and I was troubled.
Unto Thee, O Lord, will I cry, and unto my God will I make supplication.
What profit is there in my blood, when I go down into corruption?
Shall the dust praise Thee or declare Thy truth?
The Lord heard, and had mercy on me; the Lord became my helper.
Thou didst turn my mourning into joy for me; Thou didst rend my sackcloth and gird me with gladness,
That my glory may sing praises unto Thee, and that I be not pierced with sorrow. O Lord my God, I will confess Thee for ever.
