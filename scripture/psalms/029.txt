I will exalt thee, O Lord, for thou hast upheld me, and hast not made mine enemies to rejoice over me.
O Lord my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
O Lord, thou hast brought up my soul from hades; thou hast delivered me from them that go down into a pit.
Sing unto the Lord, O ye his saints, and confess the memory of his holiness.
For wrath is in his anger, but life is in his will; weeping shall find lodging for the night, but joy cometh in the morning.
And I said in my prosperity, I shall not be moved unto the age.
O Lord, by thy will thou hast furnished strength unto my beauty; but thou didst turn thy face from me, and I was troubled.
Unto thee, O Lord, will I cry, and unto my God will I make supplication.
What profit is there in my blood, when I go down into corruption? surely dust shall not confess thee, or proclaim thy truth?
The Lord hath heard, and had mercy on me; the Lord hath become my helper.
Thou didst turn my mourning into joy for me; thou didst rend my sackcloth and gird me with gladness,
That my glory may sing praises unto thee, and that I be not pierced with sorrow; O Lord my God, unto the age will I confess thee.
