O Lord my God, in thee have I put my hope; save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me.
Lest he seize my soul like a lion, while there is none to deliver or to save.
O Lord my God, if I have done this, if there be iniquity in my hands;
If I have rewarded evils unto them that rendered evil unto me, then let me fall empty from mine enemies.
Let the enemy then pursue after my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay my glory in the dust.
Arise, O Lord, in thine anger; be exalted in the ends of thine enemies.
And awake, O Lord my God, in the commandment that thou hast enjoined. So shall the congregation of the peoples compass thee about; for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
The Lord shall judge the peoples. Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to mine innocence that is in me.
Let the evil of sinners come to an end, but direct thou the just, O God, that searchest the hearts and the reins.
Righteous is my help from God, who saveth them that are upright in heart.
God is a righteous judge, strong and long suffering, and inflicteth not wrath every day.
If ye be not converted, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready,
And with it he hath prepared the instruments of death; he hath ordained his arrows for them that burn.
Behold, he hath travailed with injustice, he hath conceived toil, and brought forth iniquity.
He hath opened a pit, and digged it, and shall fall into the ditch whereof he himself made.
His toil shall return upon his own head, and upon the crown of his head shall injustice fall.
I shall confess the Lord according to his righteousness, and I shall sing unto the name of the Lord most high.
