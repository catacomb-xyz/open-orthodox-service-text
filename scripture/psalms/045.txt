Our God is refuge and power, a helper in afflictions that greatly befall us.
Therefore shall we not fear when the earth be shaken, nor when the mountains be cast into the hearts of seas.
The waters roared and were troubled; the mountains were troubled by his might.
The rushings of the river make glad the city of God; the Most High hath hallowed his tabernacle.
God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved; God shall help her in the morning early.
The nations were troubled, the kingdoms bowed down; the Most High gave forth his voice, the earth was shaken.
The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our helper.
Come and behold the works of God, what wonders he hath wrought upon the earth.
Making wars to cease unto the ends of the earth; he shall crush the bow, and shatter the weapon, and the shields he shall utterly burn with fire.
Be still, and know that I am God; I will be lifted up among the nations, I will be lifted up in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our helper.
