Our God is our refuge and strength, a help in the afflictions that come heavily upon us.
Therefore we will not fear when the earth be shaken, nor when the mountains be cast into the midst of the sea.
The waters thereof roared and were troubled; the mountains were troubled by His might.
The streams of the river make glad the city of God; the Most High hath hallowed His tabernacle.
God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved; God shall help her in the morning early.
The nations were troubled, the kingdoms were bowed down; the Most High uttered His voice, the earth was shaken.
The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our helper.
Come and behold the works of God, what wonders He hath wrought upon the earth.
He maketh wars to cease unto the ends of the earth. He shall crush the bow, and shatter the weapons, and burn the shields with fire.
Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our helper.
