I have cried unto the Lord with my voice; with my voice have I prayed unto the Lord.
My prayer shall I pour out before him; my burden before him shall I make known.
When my spirit was failing within me, then thou knewest my paths.
In this way wherein I have walked they hid for me a snare.
I looked upon my right and saw, and there was none that did know me.
Flight hath failed me, and there is none that should seek after my soul.
I have cried unto thee, O Lord; I said: Thou art my hope, my part art thou in the land of the living.
Give heed unto my prayer, for I am brought very low.
Save me from them that follow hard upon me, for they are stronger than I.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may confess thy name.
The righteous shall wait patiently for me, until thou shalt reward me.
