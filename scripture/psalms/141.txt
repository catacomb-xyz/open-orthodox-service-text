I cried unto the Lord with my voice; with my voice have I besought the Lord.
I shall pour out before him my supplication; mine affliction in his sight shall I make known.
When my spirit was failing within me, then thou knewest my paths.
In this way wherein I have walked they hid for me a snare.
I looked upon my right, and beheld, and there was none that would know me.
Flight hath failed me, and there is none who seek after my soul.
I cried unto thee, O Lord; I said: Thou art my hope, my part in the land of the living.
Attend unto my supplication, for I am brought very low.
Deliver me from them that pursue me, for they are stronger than I.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may confess thy name.
The righteous shall wait patiently for me, until thou shalt reward me.
