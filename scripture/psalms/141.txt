I have cried unto the Lord with my voice; with my voice unto the Lord have I made supplication.
I shall pour out before him my supplication; mine affliction before him shall I declare.
When my spirit was failing within me, then thou knewest my paths.
In the way wherein I walked have they hid for me a snare.
I looked upon my right, and beheld, and there was none that did know me.
Flight hath failed me, and there is none that should seek after my soul.
I have cried unto thee, O Lord; I said, Thou art my hope, my portion art thou in the land of the living.
Attend unto my supplication, for I am brought very low.
Deliver me from them that follow close upon me, for they are stronger than I.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may confess thy name.
The righteous shall wait patiently for me, until thou shalt reward me.
