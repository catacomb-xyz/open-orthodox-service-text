I cried unto the Lord with my voice; with my voice unto the Lord have I made supplication.
I will pour out my supplication before Him; mine affliction before Him will I declare.
When my spirit was fainting within me, then Thou knewest my paths.
In this way wherein I have walked they hid for me a snare.
I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was none that would know me.
Flight hath failed me, and there is none that cared for my soul.
I cried unto Thee, O Lord; I said: Thou art my hope and my portion in the land of the living.
Attend unto my supplication, for I am brought very low.
Deliver me from them that persecute me; for they are stronger than I.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto Thy Name.
The righteous shall wait patiently for me, until Thou shalt reward me.
