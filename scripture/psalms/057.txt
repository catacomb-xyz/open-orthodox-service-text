If ye truly speak of righteousness, then judge rightly, O ye sons of men.
For even in heart ye work iniquity in the earth; your hands entwined injustice.
From the womb, sinners were estranged; they went astray from the belly, speaking lies.
Their rage is in the likeness of the serpent; as of a deaf asp that stoppeth its ears,
Which will not hear a voice of enchanters, nor a charm being prepared by one wise.
God hath broken their teeth in their mouth; the Lord hath crushed together the great teeth of lions.
They shall be brought to nought as waters flowing through; he shall bend his bow until they be weakened.
Like wax that is melted, they shall be taken away; fire hath fallen upon them, and they shall not see the sun.
Before your thorns could know the brier; as if living, as if in anger, he shall swallow them up in his wrath.
A righteous man shall rejoice when he seeth vengeance; he shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.
And man shall say, If then there is fruit for the righteous; verily there is a God that judgeth them upon the earth.
