If ye truly speak of righteousness, then judge rightly, O ye sons of men.
For even in heart ye work iniquity in the earth; your hands entwined injustice.
From the womb, sinners were estranged; they went astray from the belly, speaking lies.
Their rage is like that of the serpent; like the deaf asp that stoppeth its ears,
Which will not hear the voice charming of the sorcerer, nor the sorceries being prepared by the wise.
God shall shatter their teeth in their mouth; the Lord hath crushed together the great teeth of lions.
They shall be brought to nought as waters flowing through; he shall bend his bow until they be weakened.
Like wax that is melted, they shall be taken away; fire hath fallen upon them, and they shall not see the sun.
Before your thorns could know the brier; as if living, as if in anger, he shall swallow them up in his wrath.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.
And man shall say: If then there is fruit for the righteous; verily there is a God that judgeth them upon the earth.
