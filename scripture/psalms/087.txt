O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee.
Let my prayer come before thee; incline thine ear unto my supplication.
For my soul is full of evils, and my life hath drawn nigh unto hades.
I am counted with them that go down into a pit; I am become as a man without help, free among dead.
As slain that sleep in a grave, whom thou rememberest no more, and are cut off from thy hand.
They have laid me down in a deep pit, in dark places, and in a shadow of death.
Upon me wast thine anger fixed, and thou hast brought all thy waves upon me.
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; they have made me an abomination unto themselves; I was handed over, and could not come forth
Mine eyes are weakened from poverty; I cried unto thee, O Lord, all the day; I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
Wilt thou work wonders for the dead? Or shall physicians raise them up to confess thee?
Shall any tell of thy mercy in a grave? And thy truth in destruction?
Shall thy wonders be known in the darkness? And thy righteousness in a land that is forgotten?
But I have cried unto thee, O Lord, and in the morning shall my prayer come before thee.
Wherefore, O Lord, dost thou cast off my soul, and turnest thy face away from me?
Poor am I, and in troubles from my youth; yea, having been exalted, I was humbled and brought low in distress.
Thy fierce wrath hath passed upon me, and thy terrors have troubled me.
They came round about me like water; all the day long they compassed me about altogether.
Friend and neighbour hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance because of my misery.
