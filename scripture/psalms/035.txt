The transgressor, that he may sin, hath said within himself: There is no fear of God before his eyes.
For he hath dealt deceitfully with Him, lest he should find out his iniquity, and hate it.
The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit; he willed not to understand how to do good.
He hath devised iniquity upon his bed, he hath given himself to every way that is not good, and hath not abhorred evil.
Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens, and Thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.
Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; Thy judgments are as a great deep. O Lord, Thou shalt preserve man and beast.
How Thou didst multiplied Thy mercy, O God! Let the children of men hope in the shelter of Thy wings.
They shall be drunken with the fatness of Thy house, and Thou shalt make them drink of the torrent of Thy pleasure.
For with Thee is the fountain of life; in Thy light shall we see light.
Stretch out Thy mercy unto them that know Thee, and Thy righteousness unto the upright in heart.
Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked afflict me.
There have all the workers of iniquity fallen; they are cast out, and shall not be able to stand.
