The lawless, that he may sin, saith to himself: There is no fear of God before his eyes.
For he hath dealt deceitfully before Him, to find his lawlessness and hate.
The words of his mouth are lawlessness and deceit; he willed not to understand how to do good.
He hath reasoned lawlessness upon his bed, he hath stood by every way that is not good, and hath not loathed evil.
Thy mercy is in heaven, O Lord, and Thy truth unto the clouds.
Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; thy judgments are as a great deep. O Lord, thou shalt save man and beast.
How thou hast multiplied thy mercy, O God! Therefore the sons of men will hope in the shelter of thy wings.
They shall be drunken with the fatness of thy house, and thou shalt make them drink of the rushing stream of thy delight.
For with thee is the fountain of life; in thy light shall we see light.
Stretch out thy mercy unto them that know thee, and thy righteousness unto the upright in heart.
Let not the foot of pride come to me, nor the hand of the sinner shake me.
There have all the workers of lawlessness fallen; they are cast out, and shall not be able to stand.
