The transgressor of the law saith to himself, that he may sin: There is no fear of God before his eyes.
For he hath dealt deceitfully before him, to find his iniquity and to hate.
The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit; he willed not to understand how to do good.
He hath devised iniquity upon his bed, he hath stood by every way that is not good, and hath not loathed evil.
O Lord, in heaven is thy mercy, and thy truth unto the clouds.
Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; thy judgments are as a great deep. O Lord, thou shalt save man and beast.
How thou hast multiplied thy mercy, O God; therefore the sons of men shall hope in the shelter of thy wings.
They shall be drunk from the fatness of thy house, and thou shalt give them to drink of the rushing stream of thy delight.
For with thee is the fountain of life; in thy light shall we see light.
Stretch out thy mercy unto them that know thee, and thy righteousness unto the upright in heart.
Let not the foot of pride come to me, and let not the hand of the sinner shake me.
There they have fallen, all the workers of iniquity; they have been cast out, and shall not be able to stand.
