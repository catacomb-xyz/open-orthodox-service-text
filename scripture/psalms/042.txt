Judge me, O God, and give judgment on my cause against a nation not holy; from the unjust and deceitful man deliver me.
For thou, O God, art my strength. Why hast thou cast me off, and why go I mourning whilst mine enemy afflicteth me?
Send forth thy light and thy truth; they have guided me along the way, and brought me to thy holy mountain, and to thy tabernacles.
And I shall enter in to the altar of God, to God who giveth gladness to my youth; upon the harp shall I confess thee, O God, my God.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why dost thou disquiet me? Hope thou in God, for I shall confess unto him; he is the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
