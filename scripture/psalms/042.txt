Judge me, O God, and give judgment on my cause against a nation not holy; deliver me from the unjust and deceitful man.
For Thou, O God, art my strength. Why hast Thou cast me off, and why go I mourning whilst mine enemy afflicteth me?
O send out Thy light and Thy truth; they have guided me along the way, and brought me to Thy holy mountain, and to Thy tabernacles.
And I will enter in to the altar of God, to God who giveth gladness to my youth; upon the harp will I praise Thee, O God, my God.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why dost thou trouble me? Hope thou in God, for I will give thanks unto Him; He is the salvation of my face, and my God.
