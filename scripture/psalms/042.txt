Judge me, O God, and give judgment on my cause against a nation not holy; from an unjust and deceitful man deliver me.
For thou, O God, art my strength; why hast thou cast me off, and why go I mourning whilst mine enemy afflicteth me?
Send forth thy light and thy truth; they have guided me, and brought me to thy holy mountain, and to thy tabernacles.
And I will enter in to the altar of God, to God who giveth gladness to my youth; upon a harp will I confess thee, O God, my God.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why dost thou disquiet me? Hope thou in God, for I will confess unto him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
