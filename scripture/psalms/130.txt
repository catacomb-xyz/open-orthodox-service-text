O Lord, my heart was not exalted, nor mine eyes lofty.
Neither have I walked in greatness, or in wondrous things beyond me.
If I was not humble minded, like as a child that is weaned of its mother, but had lifted my soul high, so wouldst Thou requite on behalf of my soul.
Let Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth and for evermore.
