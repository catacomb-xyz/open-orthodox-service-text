O Lord, my heart is not lifted up, nor are mine eyes lofty.
Neither have I walked in great things, nor in wondrous things beyond me.
If I was not humble minded, but had lifted my soul, like the child weaned upon its mother, so wouldst thou repay my soul.
Let Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth and unto the age.
