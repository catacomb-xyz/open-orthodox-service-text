Thou hast heard me when I called, O God of my righteousness; Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress. Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
O ye sons of men, how long will ye be heavy of heart? Why do ye love vanity, and seek after lying?
But know that the Lord hath made His holy one marvellous; the Lord will hear me when I cry unto Him.
Be angry, and sin not; be sorry upon your beds for what ye say in your hearts.
Offer the sacrifice of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord. There be many that say: Who will show us good things? The light of Thy countenance is signed upon us, O Lord.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart; from the fruit of their wheat, wine, and oil are they multiplied.
I will both lay me down in peace and sleep; for Thou, O Lord, only hast made me to dwell in hope.
