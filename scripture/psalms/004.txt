Thou hast heard me in my calling, O God of my righteousness; thou hast enlarged me in my distress; have compassion on me, and hear my prayer.
O ye sons of men, how long will ye be heavy of heart? Why do ye love vanity, and seek after lying?
But know that the Lord hath made his holy one marvellous; the Lord will hear me when I cry unto him.
Be angry, and sin not; be sorry upon your beds for what ye say in your hearts.
Sacrifice a sacrifice of righteousness, and hope in the Lord.
There be many that say, Who will show us good things? the light of thy face is signed upon us, O Lord.
Thou hast put gladness in my heart; from their fruit of wheat, wine, and oil were they multiplied.
In peace altogether I shall lay me down and sleep; for thou only, O Lord, hast made me to dwell in hope.
