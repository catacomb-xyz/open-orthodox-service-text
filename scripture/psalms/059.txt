O God, thou cast us off, and destroyed us; thou wast angered, yet didst pity us.
Thou made the earth to tremble and confounded it; heal thou the breaches thereof, for it hath been shaken.
Thou hast shown Thy people hard things; thou gave us to drink the wine of contrition.
Thou hast given a sign unto them that fear thee, that they may flee from the face of the bow.
That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hearken unto me.
God hath spoken in his holy place: I will rejoice, and divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of tents.
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of my head; Judah is my king.
Moab is the cauldron of my hope, over Edom will I stretch out my shoe; strangers are made subject unto me.
Who will lead me into the fortified city? Or who will bring me as far as Edom?
Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? And wilt not thou, O God, go out with our hosts?
Give us help from affliction, for vain is the salvation of man.
In God we shall work power, and he will bring to nought them that afflict us.
