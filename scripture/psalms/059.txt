O God, thou cast us off, and brought us down; thou wast angered, yet hast had compassion on us.
Thou made the earth to tremble and confounded it; heal thou the breaches thereof, for it hath been shaken.
Thou hast shown thy people hard things; thou gave us to drink the wine of contrition.
Thou hast given a sign unto them that fear thee, that they may flee from before the bow.
That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand and hearken unto me.
God hath spoken in his holy place, I will rejoice, and divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of the tents.
Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the support of my head; Judah is my king.
Moab is the cauldron of my hope, over Edom will I cast my sandal; foreign tribes are made subject unto me.
Who shall lead me into the fortified city? Or who shall guide me as far as Edom?
Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? And wilt not thou, O God, go out with our hosts?
Give us help from affliction, for vain is the salvation of man.
In God shall we work power, and he will bring to nought our enemies.
