O God, Thou hast cast us off, and hast destroyed us; Thou wast angered, yet didst pity us.
Thou hast made the earth to tremble, and hast troubled it; heal Thou the breaches thereof, for it hath been shaken.
Thou hast shown Thy people hard things; Thou hast made us to drink the wine of sorrow.
Thou hast given a sign unto them that fear Thee, that they may flee from the face of the bow.
That Thy beloved may be delivered, save with Thy right hand and hearken unto me.
God hath spoken in His sanctuary: I will rejoice, and divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of tents.
Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the strength of My head; Judah is My king.
Moab is the washbasin of My hope, over Edom will I stretch forth My shoe; strangers are made subject unto Me.
Who will lead Me into the fortified city? Or who will bring Me into Edom?
Will not Thou, O God, Who hast cast us off? And wilt not Thou, O God, go out with our hosts?
Give us help from affliction, for vain is the salvation of man.
Through God we shall do mighty deeds, for He will bring to nought them that afflict us.
