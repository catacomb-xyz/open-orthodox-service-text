O God, we have heard with our ears, for our fathers have told us a work which thou wrought in their days, in the days of old.
Thy hand hand destroyed nations, and thou plantedst them; thou didst afflict peoples, and cast them out.
For not by their own sword did they inherit land, neither did their own arm save them, but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, for thou wast well pleased with them.
Thou art thyself my king and my God, who commandest the salvation of Jacob.
In thee shall we gore our enemies, and in thy name shall we set to nought them that rise up against us.
For I will not hope in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
For thou hast saved us from them that afflict us, and hast put them to shame that hated us.
In God shall we boast all the day long, and in thy name shall we confess unto the age.
But now thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame, and thou, O God wilt not go forth with our powers.
Thou turned us back, rather than our enemies, and they which hated us spoil for themselves.
Thou hast given us like sheep to be eaten, and hast scattered us among the nations.
Thou sellest thy people for nought, and there was no abundance in their exchange.
Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours; mockery and scorn unto them that are round about us.
Thou makest us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.
All the day long my humiliation is before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,
From the voice that reproacheth and blasphemeth; from before enemy and pursuer.
All this is come upon us, yet we have not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
Our heart hath not drawn back, yet thou hast turned aside our steps from thy way,
For thou hast humbled us in a place of affliction, and covered us in a shadow of death.
If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god,
Shall not God search this out? For he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
For thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for slaughter.
Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? Arise, and cast us not off for ever.
Wherefore thou turnest away thy face? Dost thou forgettest our poverty and affliction?
For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly hath cleaved to the earth.
Arise, O Lord, help us, and redeem us for thy name's sake.
