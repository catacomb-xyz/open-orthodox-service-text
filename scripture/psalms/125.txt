When the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion, we became as men that are comforted.
Then was our mouth was filled with gladness, and our tongue with joy.
Then shall they say among the nations: The Lord hath done great things unto them.
The Lord hath done great things for us, and we are become glad.
Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south.
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
They went on and wept, as they cast their seed.
But they shall come again with rejoicing, taking up their sheaves with them.
