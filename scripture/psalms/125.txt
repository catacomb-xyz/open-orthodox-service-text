When the Lord turned about the captivity of Sion, we became as men comforted.
Then was our mouth was filled with gladness, and our tongue with rejoicing.
Then shall they say among the nations: The Lord hath been magnified to do with them.
The Lord hath been magnified to do with us, and we are become glad.
Turn about our captivity, O Lord, as the torrents in the south.
They that sow in tears shall reap in exultation.
They goeth forth and weepeth, casting out their seed.
But doubtless they shall come again with rejoicing, taking up their sheaves.
