I believed, therefore I spake, yet I am brought very low.
I said in my madness, Every man is a liar.
What shall I render unto the Lord for all that he hath rendered unto me?
I will take a cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows unto the Lord before all his people.
Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
O Lord, I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaiden; thou hast broken my bonds asunder.
I will sacrifice unto thee a sacrifice of praise, and I will call upon the name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows unto the Lord before all his people,
In the courts of the house of the Lord, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
