I believed, therefore have I spoken; I am brought very low.
I said in my madness: All men are liars.
What shall I repay unto the Lord for all that he hath repaid unto me?
I shall take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.
I shall pay my vows unto the Lord before all His people.
Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
O Lord, I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaiden; thou hast broken my bonds asunder.
I shall sacrifice unto thee a sacrifice of praise, and I shall call upon the name of the Lord.
I shall pay my vows unto the Lord before all his people, in the courts of the house of the Lord, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
