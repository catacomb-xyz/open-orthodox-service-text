Rescue me, O Lord, from an evil man; from an unrighteous man deliver me;
Who conceived injustice in their heart; all the day long were they arrayed together for war.
They sharpened their tongues like a serpent; poison of asps is under their lips.
Keep me, O Lord, from a hand of a sinner; deliver me from unjust men, from them who thought to make my steps to stumble.
Proud men have hid a snare for me, and with cords they spread a snare for my feet; by a path they set stumbling blocks for me.
I said unto the Lord, Thou art my God; give ear, O Lord, unto the voice of my supplication.
O Lord, O Lord, the strength of my salvation; thou hast overshadowed my head in a day of battle.
Give me not up unto a sinner, O Lord, according to my desire; they have taken council against me; forsake me not, lest they should be exalted.
The head of their encircling, toil of their lips shall cover them.
Coals shall fall upon them; thou shalt cast them down into fire, into miseries they shall not endure.
A man of much talking shall not prosper upon the earth; on unrighteous man shall evils hunt unto destruction.
I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the poor, and the justice of the needy.
But the righteous shall confess thy name, and the upright shall dwell it thy presence.
