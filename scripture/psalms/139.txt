Rescue me, O Lord, from the evil man; from the unrighteous man deliver me;
Who conceived injustice in their heart; all the day long were they arrayed together for war.
They sharpened their tongues like a serpent; the poison of asps is under their lips.
Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the sinner; deliver me from unjust men, from them who thought to make my steps to stumble.
The proud have hid a snare for me, and with cords they spread a snare for my feet; stumbling blocks have they set for me beside the way.
I said unto the Lord: Thou art my God; give ear, O Lord, unto the voice of my supplication.
O Lord, O Lord, the strength of my salvation; thou hast overshadowed my head in the day of battle.
Give me not up unto the sinner, O Lord, according to my desire. They have taken council against me; forsake me not, lest they should be exalted.
The head of their encircling, the toil of their lips shall cover them.
Coals shall fall upon them; thou shalt cast them down into the fire, into miseries they shall not endure.
A man of much talking shall not prosper upon the earth; on unrighteous man shall evils hunt unto destruction.
I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the poor, and the justice of the needy.
Surely the righteous shall confess thy Name, and the upright shall dwell it thy presence.
