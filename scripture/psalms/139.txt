Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man; from the unrighteous man rescue me;
Who conceived iniquity in their heart; all the day long are they gathered together for war.
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; the poison of asps is under their lips.
Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the sinner; deliver me from unjust men who have conspired to overthrow my steps.
The proud have hid a snare for me, and with cords spread a net for my feet; they have set stumbling blocks for me beside the way.
I said unto the Lord: Thou art my God; give ear, O Lord, unto the voice of my supplication.
Lord, O Lord, the strength of my salvation; Thou hast overshadowed my head in the day of battle.
Give me not over unto the sinner, O Lord, according to my desire. They have taken council against me; forsake me not, lest they should be exalted.
The head of their encircling, the toil of their lips shall cover them.
Coals shall fall upon them; Thou shalt cast them down into the fire, into wretchedness they shall not endure.
A long-tongued man shall not prosper upon the earth; evils shall hunt an unrighteous man unto destruction.
I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the poor, and the justice of the needy.
Surely the righteous shall confess Thy Name, and the upright shall dwell in Thy presence.
