Give ear, O shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep.
Thou that sittest upon the cherubim, show Thyself before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh.
Stir up Thy strength, and come to save us.
Restore us, O God, and show forth Thy face, and we shall be saved.
O Lord God of hosts, how long wilt Thou be angry against the prayer of Thy servants?
How long wilt Thou feed us with the bread of sorrow, and give us tears to drink in great measure?
Thou hast made us a strife unto our neighbours, and our enemies laugh us to scorn.
Restore us, O Lord of hosts, and show forth Thy face, and we shall be saved.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; Thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
Thou hast prepared the way before it, and Thou hast planted the roots thereof, and the earth was filled.
The mountains were covered by the shadows thereof, and the cedars of God with its boughs.
It stretched forth its branches unto the sea, and its offshoots unto the rivers.
Why didst Thou break down its hedge, so that all they that pass by the way gather its fruit?
The boar of the forest hath wasted it, and the wild beast hath fed upon it.
Restore us, O God of hosts, and look down from heaven, and behold, and visit for this vine.
And perfect that which Thy right hand hath planted, and look upon the son of man, whom Thou hast made strong for Thyself.
It is burned with fire, and dug up; they shall perish at the rebuke of Thy face.
Let Thy hand be upon the man of Thy right hand, and upon the son of man whom Thou didst strengthen for Thyself.
And we shall not depart from Thee; Thou shalt quicken us, and we shall call upon Thy Name.
Restore us, O Lord God of hosts, and show forth Thy face, and we shall be saved.
