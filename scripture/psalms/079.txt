Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph as a sheep; thou that sittest upon the cherubim, make thyself manifest.
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, awaken thy power, and come to save us.
O God, make us to return, and show forth thy face, and we shall be saved.
O Lord God of powers, how long wilt thou be wroth against the prayer of thy servant?
Wilt thou feed us bread of tears? And give us tears to drink in great measure?
Thou hast made us a contradiction unto our neighbours, and our enemies laughed us to scorn.
O Lord of powers, make us to return, and show forth thy face, and we shall be saved.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; thou hast cast out nations, and planted it.
Thou hast prepared the way before it, and thou hast planted the roots thereof, and it filled the land.
Mountains were covered by the shadows thereof, and its boughs the cedars of God.
It stretched out its branches unto the sea, and unto the river its offshoots.
Why didst thou break down its hedge, so that all they that pass by the way gather its fruit?
A boar of the forest hath wasted it, and a wild beast hath fed upon it.
O God of powers, return again, and look down from heaven and see, and visit this vine,
And perfect that which thy right hand hath planted, and upon a son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
It is burned with fire and dug up; at the rebuke of thy face they shall perish.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, and upon a son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
And we shall not depart from thee; thou shalt quicken us, and we shall call upon thy name.
O Lord God of powers, make us to return, and show forth thy face, and we shall be saved.
