The Lord is king; let the peoples rage: he who sitteth upon the cherubim, let the earth be moved.
The Lord is great in Sion, and he is high over all the peoples.
Let them confess thy great name, for it is fearsome and holy.
The king's honour loveth judgment. Thou hast established uprightness; thou hast wrought judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
Lift ye up the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the Lord, and he heard them.
He spake unto them in the pillar of the cloud, for they kept his testimonies and his ordinances which he gave them.
O Lord our God, thou didst hear them; O God, thou wast merciful unto them, and avenging unto all their devices.
Lift ye up the Lord our God, and worship at his holy mountain; for holy is the Lord our God.
