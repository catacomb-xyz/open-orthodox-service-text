The Lord reigneth; let the peoples rage: He sitteth upon the cherubim, let the earth be moved.
The Lord is great in Sion, and He is high above all the peoples.
Let them praise Thy great Name, for it is awesome and holy.
The king's honour loveth judgment. Thou dost establish uprightness; Thou executeth judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at His footstool; for He is holy.
Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His Name; they called upon the Lord, and He hearkened unto them.
He spake unto them in the pillar of the cloud, for they kept His testimonies, and the ordinances that He gave them.
O Lord our God, Thou didst hearken unto them; Thou wast merciful unto them, O God, yet Thou wast vengeful unto all their wrongdoing.
Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at His holy mountain; for holy is the Lord our God.
