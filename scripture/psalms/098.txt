The Lord is king, let peoples be wroth; he who sitteth upon the cherubim, let the earth be moved.
The Lord is great in Sion, and is high above all peoples.
Let them confess thy great name, for it is fearsome and holy.
A king's honour also loveth judgment; thou hast established uprightness; thou hast executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the Lord, and he heard them.
He spake unto them in a pillar of cloud, for they kept his testimonies and his ordinances which he gave them.
O Lord our God, thou didst hear them; O God, thou wast merciful unto them, and avenging unto all their pursuits.
Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his holy mountain; for holy is the Lord our God.
