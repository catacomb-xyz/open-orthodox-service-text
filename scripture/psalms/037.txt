O Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, neither chasten me in Thy wrath.
For Thine arrows are stuck fast in me, and Thou hast strengthened Thy hand against me.
There is no healing in my flesh because of Thy displeasure, neither is there any peace in my bones because of my sins.
For mine iniquities have risen over my head; as a sore burden have they pressed heavily upon me.
My wounds are become noisome and corrupt because of my foolishness.
I am troubled and bowed down greatly; I went with mourning all the day long.
For my loins are filled with mockings, and there is no healing in my flesh.
I am troubled and made exceedingly low; I have roared by reason of the groaning of my heart.
Lord, all my desire is before Thee, and my groaning is not hid from Thee.
My heart is troubled, my strength hath failed me; even the light of mine eyes is gone from me.
My friends and my neighbours drew near and stood over against me, and my kinsmen stood afar off.
They that sought my soul used violence, and they that sought my hurt spake vanities, and imagined deceits all the day long.
But I was as a deaf man, and heard not, and as a speechless man, that openeth not his mouth.
And I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in Thee, O Lord, have I hoped; Thou wilt hearken unto me, O Lord my God.
For I said: Let never mine enemies rejoice over me; for when my feet were shaken, they made boastful words against me.
For I am prepared for scourges, and my sorrow is continually before me.
For I will declare mine iniquity, and I will take heed concerning my sin.
But mine enemies live, and are made stronger than I, and they that hated me wrongfully are multiplied.
They that render me evil for good have slandered me, because I pursued goodness.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God; depart not from me.
Attend unto my help, O Lord of my salvation.
