O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy wrath.
For thine arrows hath stuck fast in me, and thy hand hath been strong upon me.
There is no healing in my flesh from the face of thy wrath, neither is there peace in my bones from the face of my sins.
For my lawless deeds have risen over my head; as a sore burden have they weighed heavily upon me.
My wounds are become noisome and corrupt from the face of my folly.
I am made a wretch, and am bowed down even to the end; I went with sorrow all the day long.
For my loins were filled with mockings, and there is no healing in my flesh.
I was afflicted and sorely humbled; I have roared by reason of the groaning of my heart.
O Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning was not hid from thee.
My heart was troubled, my strength hath forsaken me; even the light of mine eyes is gone from me.
My friends and my neighbours drew near and stood against me, and my kinsmen stood afar off.
They that sought my soul used violence, and they that sought my hurt spake vanities, and imagined deceits all the day long.
But I was as a deaf man, and heard not, and as a speechless man, that openeth not his mouth.
And I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped; thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God.
For I said: Let not mine enemies rejoice over me; for when my feet were shaken, they made boastful words against me.
For I am prepared for scourges, and my pain is ever before me.
For I shall declare mine iniquity, and take thought of my sin.
But mine enemies live, and are made stronger than I, and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
They that render me evil for good have slandered me, because I pursued goodness.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God; depart not from me.
Give heed unto my help, O Lord of my salvation.
