O Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, neither chasten me in Thy wrath.
For Thine arrows are stuck fast in me, and Thou hast pressed Thy hand heavily upon me.
There is no healing in my flesh because of Thy displeasure, neither is there any peace in my bones because of my sins.
For mine iniquities are risen over my head; as a heavy burden have they pressed sore upon me.
My wounds are become noisome and corrupt, because of my foolishness.
I am troubled and bowed down greatly; I went with mourning countenance all the day long.
For my loins are filled with mockings, and there is no healing in my flesh.
I am troubled and brought down greatly; I have roared by reason of the groaning of my heart.
Lord, all my desire is before Thee, and my groaning is not hid from Thee.
My heart is troubled, my strength hath failed me; as for the light of mine eyes, even it is gone from me.
My friends and my neighbours drew near and stood over against me, and my kinsmen stood afar off.
They that sought after my soul used violence, and they that sought my hurt spake vanities, and imagined deceits all the day long.
But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a speechless man that openeth not his mouth.
And I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in Thee, O Lord, have I hoped; Thou wilt hearken unto me, O Lord my God.
For I said: Let never mine enemies rejoice over me; for when my feet were shaken, they made boastful words against me.
For I am ready for scourges, and my sorrow is continually before me.
For I will declare mine iniquity, and I will take heed concerning my sin.
But mine enemies live, and are made stronger than I, and they that hated me wrongfully are multiplied.
They that render me evil for good have slandered me, because I pursued goodness.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God; depart not from me.
Make haste to help me, O Lord of my salvation.
