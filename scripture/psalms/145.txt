Praise the Lord, O my soul. I shall praise the Lord in my life, I shall chant unto my God while I have my being.
Put not your trust in princes, in sons of men, in whom there is no salvation.
His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return unto his earth.
In that day all his thoughts shall perish.
Blessed is he whose helper is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God;
Who hath made the heaven and the earth, the sea and all that is therein.
Who keepeth truth unto the age, who executeth judgment for the wronged, who giveth food unto the hungry.
The Lord looseth ones fettered; the Lord giveth wisdom unto blind; the Lord setteth aright fallen; the Lord loveth ones righteous; the Lord preserveth the proselytes.
He will take up orphan and widow, and a sinner's way he will destroy.
The Lord will rule as king unto the age; thy God, O Sion, unto generation and generation.
