I lifted up mine eyes unto the mountains, from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh from the Lord, Who hath made heaven and the earth.
Let not thy foot be moved, nor him who keepeth thee to slumber.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord shall keep thee; the Lord is thy shelter upon thy right hand.
The sun shall not burn thee by day, nor the moon by night.
The Lord shall keep thee from all evil; he shall keep thy soul.
The Lord shall keep thy going in and thy going out, from now and unto the age.
