Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise him in the highest.
Praise him, all ye his angels; praise him, all ye his powers.
Praise him, O sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars and light.
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and thou water above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of the Lord; for he spake, and they came to be; he commanded, and they were created.
he hath established them unto the age, and unto the age of age; he hath made an ordinance, and it shall not pass away.
Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons and all deeps.
Fire, hail, snow, ice, winds of tempest, fulfilling His word;
The mountains and all the hills; fruitful trees and all cedars;
Beasts and all cattle; creeping things and winged birds;
Kings of the earth and all people; princes and all the judges of the earth;
Young men and maidens; elders with the younger;
Let them praise the name of the Lord, for the name of him alone hath been exalted.
His confession is above the earth and heaven, and he shall lift up the horn of his people;
A hymn for all his saints, for the children of Israel, for the people that draw nigh unto him.
