O God, nations are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have made Jerusalem as a hut of a garden keeper.
The slain bodies of thy servants they made as meat for the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth.
They poured out their blood like water round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.
We are become a reproach unto our neighbours; mockery and scorn unto them that are round about us.
How long, O Lord? Wilt thou be utterly provoked to anger? Shall thy zeal burn as fire?
Pour out thy wrath upon nations that have not known thee, and upon kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
Remember not our iniquities of old; let thy compassions swiftly overtake us, O Lord, for we are become exceedingly poor.
Help us, O God our saviour, for the sake of the glory of thy name; O Lord, deliver us, and be forgiving unto our sins for thy name's sake.
Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their God? Yea, let it be made known among the nations, them before our very eyes, the avenging of the blood poured forth of thy servants.
Let the groaning of them in fetters come before thee; according to the greatness of thine arm, show thy care for the sons of the slain.
Repay unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
So we are thy people and sheep of thy pasture will confess thee, O God, unto the age; we will show forth thy praise to generation and generation.
