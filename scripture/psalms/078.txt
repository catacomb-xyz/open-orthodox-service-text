O God, the nations are come into thine inheritance; they have stained thy holy temple; they have made Jerusalem as the hut of the garden keeper.
The slain bodies of thy servants they made meat for the fowls of heaven, the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth.
Their blood have they poured out like water round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.
We are made shame unto our neighbours; mockery and scorn unto them that are round about us.
How long, O Lord? Wilt thou be wrathful unto the end? Shall thy zeal burn as fire?
Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
For they have swallowed up Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
Remember not our lawless acts of old; let thy compassions swiftly overtake us, O Lord, for we are become utterly poor.
Help us, O God our saviour, for the sake of the glory of thy name; O Lord, deliver us, and be forgiving unto our sins for thy name's sake.
Lest ever the nations say: Where is their God? Yea, let it be made known among the nations, them before our own very eyes, the avenging of the blood poured forth of thy servants.
Let the groaning of them in fetters come before thee; according to the greatness of thine arm, show thy care for the sons of the slain.
Repay unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
But we are thy people, and the sheep of thy pasture. We will give thanks unto thee unto the age; we shall declare thy praise from generation to generation.
