O God, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance; Thy holy temple have they defiled; they have made Jerusalem as the hut of the orchard keeper.
The dead bodies of Thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heavens, the flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.
We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision unto them that are round about us.
How long, O Lord? Wilt Thou be angry for ever? Shall Thy jealousy be kindled like fire?
Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that have not known Thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon Thy Name.
For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
O remember not our former iniquities; let Thy compassions quickly go before us, O Lord, for we are become exceedingly poor.
Help us, O God our Saviour, on account of the glory of Thy Name; deliver us, O Lord, and wash away our sins for Thy Name's sake.
Lest ever the nations say: Where is their God? Yea, let the vengeance for the blood of Thy servants which hath been shed be known among the nations in our sight.
Let the groaning of the prisoners come before Thee; according to the greatness of Thine arm, show Thy care for the sons of the slain.
And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached Thee, O Lord.
For we are Thy people and the sheep of Thy pasture. We will give thanks unto Thee for ever; we will show forth Thy praise from generation to generation.
