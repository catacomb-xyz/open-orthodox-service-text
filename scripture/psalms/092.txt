The Lord is King, He is clothed with majesty; the Lord is clothed with power and hath girded Himself; for He hath established the world, which shall not be moved.
Thy throne is prepared of old, Thou art from everlasting.
The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods shall lift up their waves, from the voice of many waters.
Wonderful are the heights of the sea; the Lord is wonderful in those on high.
Thy testimonies are made very sure. Holiness becometh Thy house, O Lord, unto length of days.
