The Lord is King, He is clothed with majesty; the Lord is clothed with strength and hath girded Himself; for He hath established the world, which shall not be moved.
Thy throne is prepared of old, Thou art from everlasting.
The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods shall lift up their waves at the voice of many waters.
Wonderful are the heights of the sea, the Lord is wonderful on high.
Thy testimonies are very sure; holiness becometh Thy house, O Lord, unto length of days.
