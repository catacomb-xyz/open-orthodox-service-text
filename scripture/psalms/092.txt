The Lord is king, he is clothed with majesty; the Lord is clothed with power, and hath girded Himself; for he hath established the world, which shall not be moved.
Thy throne is prepared of old, thou art from the age.
The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods shall lift up their waves, from the voices of many waters.
Wonderful are the heights of the sea; the Lord is wonderful in those on high.
Thy testimonies are made very sure. Holiness becometh thy house, O Lord, unto length of days.
