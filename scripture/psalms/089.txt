Lord, thou hast become for us a refuge in all generations.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, from the age, and until the age, thou art.
Turn not man away unto lowliness, and thou said, Turn back, ye sons of men.
For a thousand years in thy sight, O Lord, are like the day of yesterday which passed, and like a watch in the night.
Years shall be the objects of their scorn; as the green herb in the morning so shall it pass away.
In the morning he shall flourish and pass away; in the evening may it fall, become withered and dry.
For we have perished in thy wrath, and in thine anger have we been troubled.
Thou hast set our iniquities before thee; the span of our life in the light of thy face.
For all our days have vanished, and in thy wrath we have come to an end; our years are reckoned as a spider's web.
The days of our years, in them are seventy years, and if we be in strength, then eighty years, yet the greater share of these is labour and sorrow, for meekness comes upon us, and we shall be corrected.
Who knoweth the power of thine anger? And from thy fear, who can number thy wrath?
Make thus thy right hand known unto me, and unto them instructed in heart by wisdom.
Turn back, O Lord; how long? And be thou gracious unto thy servants.
In the mourning we were filled full of thy mercy, O Lord, and we shall rejoice and be glad in all our days.
Let us be glad for the days of which thou hast humbled us, for the years wherein we have seen evils.
And look upon thy servants, and upon thy works, and guide thou their sons.
And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish thou the work of our hands upon us, yea, establish thou the work of our hands.
