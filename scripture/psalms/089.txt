Lord, Thou hast been our refuge in generation and generation.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever Thou hadst formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting Thou art.
Turn not man away unto lowliness; yea, Thou hast said: Return, ye children of men.
For a thousand years in Thy sight, O Lord, are like yesterday when it is past, and like a watch in the night.
Things of no account shall their years be; as the grass in the morning so shall man pass away.
In the morning he shall flourish and grow up, but in the evening he shall fall and become withered and dry.
For we have fainted away in Thy wrath, and in Thine anger have we been troubled.
Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee, our life in the light of Thy countenance.
For all our days are spent, and in Thy wrath have we fainted away; our years like a spider have spun out their tale.
The days of our lives are numbered seventy years, and if we be in strength, then eighty years; yet the greater portion of these is labour and travail, for weakness comes upon us, and we shall be chastened.
Who knoweth the might of Thy wrath? And for fear of Thee who can recount Thy anger?
So make Thy right hand known to me, and to them that are learned in heart by wisdom.
Return, O Lord; how long? And be Thou gracious unto Thy servants.
We were filled with Thy mercy in the mourning, O Lord, and we shall rejoice and be glad with all our days.
Gladden us for the days in which Thou hast humbled us, for the years wherein we have seen evils.
And look upon Thy servants, and upon Thy works, and guide Thou their children.
And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish Thou the work of our hands upon us, yea, establish Thou the work of our hands.
