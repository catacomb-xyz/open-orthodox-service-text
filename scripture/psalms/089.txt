Lord, thou hast been our refuge in all generations.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, from the age and until the age, thou art.
Turn not man away unto lowliness; yea, thou said: Turn back, ye sons of men.
For a thousand years in thy sight, O Lord, are like the day of yesterday which passed, and like a watch in the night.
Years shall be the objects of their scorn; as the grass in the morning so shall man pass away.
In the morning he shall flourish and pass away; in the evening he shall fall and become withered and dry.
For we were consumed by thy wrath, and in thine anger we were troubled.
Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our life in the light of thy countenance.
For all our days have vanished, and in Thy wrath we have come to an end; our years like a spider have spun out their tale.
As for the days of our years, in them are seventy years, and if we be in strength, then eighty years; yet the greater portion of these is labour and travail, for weakness comes upon us, and we shall be chastened.
Who knoweth the power of thy wrath? And for fear of thee, who can count thy anger?
Make thus thy right hand known to me, and to them that are instructed in heart by wisdom.
Turn back, O Lord; how long? And be thou gracious unto thy servants.
In the mourning we were filled full of thy mercy, O Lord, and we shall rejoice and be glad in all our days.
Let us be glad for the days of which thou hast humbled us, for the years wherein we have seen evils.
And look upon thy servants, and upon thy works, and guide thou their sons.
And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish thou the work of our hands upon us, yea, establish thou the work of our hands.
