Shout with joy unto the Lord, all the earth.
Sing praises unto his name, give glory in his praise.
Say unto God, How fearful are thy works! through the multitude of thy power shall thine enemies be found false unto thee.
Let all the earth worship thee, and let them sing praises unto thee; let them sing to thy name, O thou most high.
Come and see the works of God, fearful in his counsels over the sons of men.
Who turneth the sea into dry land; in the river shall they pass through on foot; there shall we rejoice in him.
Who hath dominion by his power over the age; his eyes behold the nations, let not them that embitter be lifted up in themselves.
Bless our God, O ye nations, and make the voice of his praise to be heard,
Who hath established my soul in life, and suffereth not my feet to be moved.
For thou hast proved us, O God, and hast tried us by fire, even as silver is tried.
Thou didst bring us into the snare, thou didst lay afflictions upon our back.
Thou madest men to mount upon our heads; we went through fire and water, but thou didst lead us out into refreshment.
I will go into thy house with whole burnt offerings; I will pay my vows unto thee, which my lips have proclaimed, and my mouth hath spoken, in mine affliction.
Whole burnt offerings full of marrow will I offer unto thee, with incense and rams; I will offer unto thee young bulls with goats.
Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare all he hath done for my soul.
Unto him have I cried out with my mouth, and exalted with my tongue.
If I beheld unrighteousness in my heart, let not the Lord hear me.
Therefore God hath heard me; he hath attended unto the voice of my supplication.
Blessed be God, who hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
