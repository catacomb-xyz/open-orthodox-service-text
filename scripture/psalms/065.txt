Shout with joy unto the Lord, all the earth.
Sing praises unto His Name, give glory in praise of Him.
Say unto God: How fearsome are Thy works. In the greatness of Thy power shall Thine enemies be found false unto Thee.
Let all the earth worship Thee, and let them sing unto Thee; let them sing to thy name, O thou most high.
Come and see the works of God, fearsome in His counsels over the children of men.
He turneth the sea into dry land; in the river shall they pass through on foot; there shall we rejoice in Him.
He ruleth by His power for ever. His eyes behold the nations; let not them that embitter Him be lifted up in themselves.
O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of His praise to be heard,
Who hath established my soul in life, and suffereth not my feet to be moved.
For Thou hast proved us, O God, and hast tried us by fire, even as silver is tried.
Thou didst bring us into the snare, Thou didst lay afflictions upon our back.
Thou madest men to mount upon our heads; we went through fire and water, but Thou didst lead us out into refreshment.
I will go into Thy house with a whole burnt offering; I will pay Thee my vows, which my lips have proclaimed, and my mouth hath spoken, in mine affliction.
I will offer unto Thee burnt sacrifices, full of marrow, with incense and rams; I will offer Thee bullocks with goats.
Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I shall tell of all he hath done for my soul.
Unto him have I cried out with my mouth, and lifted up by my tongue.
If I had seen unrighteousness in my heart, let not the Lord hear me.
Therefore God hath heard me; He hath attended unto the voice of my supplication.
Blessed be God, Who hath not turned away my prayer, nor His mercy from me.
