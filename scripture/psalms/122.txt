Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, O Thou that dwellest in the heavens.
Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, as the eyes of a handmaiden look unto the hands of her mistress, so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, until He take pity upon us.
Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us, for we are greatly filled with contempt.
Our soul hath been exceedingly filled with it; let reproach come upon those that prosper, and abasement upon the proud.
