Unto thee have I lifted up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heaven.
Behold, as servants eye's look unto the hands of their masters, as a handmaiden eye's look unto the hands of her mistress, so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, until he should have compassion on us.
Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us, for we have been greatly filled with contempt.
Our soul hath been more greatly filled; the reproach unto them that prosper, and contempt unto the proud.
