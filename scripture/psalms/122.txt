Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in heaven.
Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, as the eyes of a handmaiden look unto the hands of her mistress, so do our eyes look unto the Lord our God, until he should have compassion us.
Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us, for we have been greatly filled with contempt, our soul hath been more greatly filled; the reproach to them that prosper, and contempt to the proud.
