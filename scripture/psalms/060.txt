Hearken, O God, unto my supplication; attend unto my prayer.
From the ends of the earth have I cried unto thee, as my heart was in anguish; thou didst lift me high upon a rock.
Thou hast guided me, for thou hast become my hope, a tower of strength from before mine enemy.
I will dwell in thy tabernacle unto the ages; I shall be sheltered under the cover of thy wings.
For thou, O God, hast heard my prayers; thou gavest an inheritance unto them that fear thy Name.
Thou wilt add days to days unto the king, his years until the days of generation and generation.
He shall continue unto the age before the face of God; his mercy and truth, who shall search them out?
So will I sing praise unto thy name unto the ages, that I may pay my vows from day to day.
