Hearken, O God, unto my supplication; attend unto my prayer.
From the ends of the earth have I cried unto Thee, when my heart was overwhelmed, and Thou didst lift me high upon a rock.
Thou hast guided me, for Thou hast been my hope, a strong tower against the face of the enemy.
I will abide in Thy tabernacle for ever; I shall be sheltered under the cover of Thy wings.
For Thou, O God, hast heard my prayers; Thou gavest an inheritance to those that fear Thy Name.
Thou wilt prolong the kingâ€™s days, that his years endure throughout all generations.
He shall abide before the face of God for ever; As for His mercy and truth, who shall search them out?
So will I sing praise unto Thy Name for ever and ever, that I may render my vows day to day.
