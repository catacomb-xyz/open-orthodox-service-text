O God, hear my supplication; attend unto my prayer.
From the ends of the earth have I cried unto thee; in the accidie of my heart, thou hast exalted me upon a rock.
Thou hast guided me, for thou hast become my hope, a tower of strength from the face of mine enemy.
I shall sojourn in thy tabernacle unto the ages; I shall be sheltered under the cover of thy wings.
For thou, O God, hast heard my vows; thou gavest an inheritance unto them that fear thy name.
Thou wilt add days to days of the king, his years unto the days of generation and generation.
He shall remain unto the age before the face of God; his mercy and truth, who shall search them out?
So shall I sing praise to thy name unto the ages, that I may pay my vows from day to day.
