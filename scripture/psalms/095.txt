O sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth.
Sing unto the Lord, bless His Name; show forth the good news of His salvation from day to day.
Declare His glory among the heathen, and His wonders among all people.
For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the nations are demons, but the Lord made the heavens.
Praise and beauty are before Him; holiness and majesty are in His sanctuary.
Bring unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the nations, bring unto the Lord glory and honour; bring unto the Lord the glory due unto His Name.
Bring offerings, and go into His courts. Worship the Lord in His holy court; let all the earth be moved at His presence.
Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth, for He hath established the world, which shall not be moved; He shall judge the people uprightly.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea be moved, and the fulness thereof. The fields shall rejoice, and all that is therein.
Then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord; for He cometh, for He cometh to judge the earth.
He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with His truth.
