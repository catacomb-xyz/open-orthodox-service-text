O sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth.
Sing unto the Lord, bless his name; bring glad tidings of his salvation from day to day.
Show forth his glory among the nations; his wonders among all the peoples.
For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the nations are demons, but the Lord made the heavens.
Confession and beauty are before him; holiness and majesty are in his holy place.
Bring unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the nations, bring unto the Lord glory and honour; bring unto the Lord the glory due his name.
Take up offerings, and enter ye into his courts; worship the Lord in his holy court. Let all the earth tremble before His presence.
Say among the nations: the Lord is king, for he hath established the world so that it shall not be moved; he shall judge the peoples in uprightness.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea resound, and the fullness thereof; let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.
Then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice from the face of the Lord; for he himself cometh, he himself cometh to judge the earth.
He shall judge the world in righteousness, and the peoples in his truth.
