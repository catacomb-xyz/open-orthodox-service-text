O sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth.
Sing unto the Lord, bless His Name; show forth the good tidings of His salvation from day to day.
Declare His glory among the nations, and His wonders among all the peoples.
For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the nations are demons, but the Lord made the heavens.
Praise and beauty are before Him; holiness and majesty are in His sanctuary.
Bring unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the nations, bring unto the Lord glory and honour; bring unto the Lord the glory due unto His Name.
Take up offerings, and go ye into His courts; worship the Lord in His holy court. Let all the earth tremble before His presence.
Say among the nations: the Lord is king, for He hath established the world so that it shall not be moved; He shall judge the people in uprightness.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea resound, and the fulness thereof; let the fields shall rejoice, and all that is therein.
Then shall all the trees of the forest rejoice before the Lord; for He Himself cometh, He Himself cometh to judge the earth.
He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with His truth.
