O sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth.
Sing unto the Lord, bless his name; bring glad tidings of his salvation from day to day.
Declare his glory among the nations; his wonders among all people.
For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all the gods.
For all the gods of the nations are demons, but the Lord hath made the heavens.
Confession and beauty are before him; holiness and majesty are in his holy place.
Bring unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the nations, bring unto the Lord glory and honour.
Bring unto the Lord the glory due his name; take up offerings, and enter ye into his courts.
Worship the Lord in his holy court. Let all the earth be shaken before his presence.
Say among the nations, the Lord is king, for he hath established the world so that it shall not be moved; he shall judge peoples in uprightness.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea resound, and the fullness thereof.
Let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein; then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice from the face of the Lord.
For he cometh, he cometh to judge the earth; he shall judge the world in righteousness, and the people in his truth.
