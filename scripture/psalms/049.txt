The God of gods, the Lord, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the setting thereof.
Out of Sion is the magnificence of His perfect beauty.
God, our God, shall come visibly, and shall not keep silence.
A fire shall blaze before Him, and a mighty tempest shall be round about Him.
He shall call to Himself the heavens above and the earth, that He may judge His people.
Gather together unto Him His saints, those that have established His covenant by sacrifice.
And the heavens shall declare His righteousness; for God Himself is judge.
Hear, O My people, and I will speak unto thee, O Israel, and I will testify against thee; I am God, thy God.
I will not reprove thee for sacrifices, for thy burnt offerings are continually before Me.
I will not welcome bullocks out of thy house, nor he-goats out of thy flocks.
For they are all Mine, beasts of the field, cattle upon the mountains, and oxen.
I know all the birds of the heavens, and the beauty of the fields is Mine.
If I were hungry, I would not tell thee, for the world is Mine, and all the fulness thereof.
Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
Sacrifice unto God a sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows unto the Most High.
And call upon Me in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliver thee; and thou shalt glorify Me.
But unto the wicked God hath said: Why dost thou declare My statutes, and takest My covenant in thy mouth?
Thou hast hated instruction, and hast cast My words behind thee.
When thou sawest a thief, then thou didst run with him, and thou hast been partaker with the adulterer.
Thy mouth hath multiplied evil, and thy tongue hath woven deceits.
Thou didst sit and speak against thy brother, and didst lay a scandal against thy mother's son.
These things thou hast done, and I kept silence. Thou thoughtest wickedly that I should be like thee, but I will reprove thee, and set thy sins before thine eyes.
Understand these things, ye that forget God, lest He snatch you away, and there be none to deliver.
A sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me, and there is the way wherein I will show him My salvation.
