Blessed is the man that hath walked not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the pestilent.
But his will is rather in the law of the Lord, and in his law shall he meditate day and night.
And he shall be like the tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not fall, and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
Not so are the ungodly, not so; but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away from the face of the earth.
Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the council of the righteous.
For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
