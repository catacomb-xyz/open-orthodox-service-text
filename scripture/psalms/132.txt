Behold now, what is good or what is delightful, but for brethren to dwell as one?
It is like the oil of myrrh upon the head, that runneth down upon the beard, upon the beard of Aaron, that runneth down to the fringes of his garment;
It is like the dew of Hermon, which falleth upon the hills of Sion: for there the Lord enjoined the blessing, of life for evermore.
