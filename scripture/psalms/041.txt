As the hart longeth after the springs of water, so longeth my soul after thee, O God.
My soul thirsted after God, the mighty and the living; when shall I come, and appear before the very face of God?
My tears became bread for me by day and by night, while each day they say to me: Where is thy God?
These I remembered, and I poured out my soul upon me; for I shall pass through to the place of the wondrous tabernacle, as far as the house of God, with a voice of rejoicing and confession, yea, of the sound of them keeping feast.
Why then art thou cast down, O my soul, and why dost thou confound me? Hope thou in God, for I shall confess unto him; the salvation of my face, and my God.
Within me my soul hath been troubled; therefore shall I remember thee, from the land of Jordan and Hermon, from the little mountain.
Deep calleth unto deep at the voice of thy flood gates; all thy billows and thy waves have come over me.
By day, the Lord will command his mercy, and by night, his song shall be with me, my prayer unto the God of my life.
I shall say unto God: Thou art my help; wherefore hast thou forgotten me? And why go I mourning while mine enemy afflicteth me?
When my bones were broken, mine enemies reproached me, when they say daily unto me: Where is thy God?
Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why dost thou confound me? Hope thou in God, for I shall confess unto him; he is the salvation of my face, and my God.
