As the hart longeth after the springs of water, so longeth my soul after thee, O God.
My soul thirsted after God, the mighty and the living; when shall I come, and appear before the very face of God?
My tears became bread for me by day and by night, while each day they say to me: Where is thy God?
These I remembered, and I poured out my soul upon me; for I will go to the place of the wondrous tabernacle, to the house of God, with a voice of rejoicing and thanksgiving, yea, of the sound of them keeping feast.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why dost thou trouble me? Hope thou in God, for I shall confess unto him; the salvation of my face, and my God.
Within me my soul hath been troubled; therefore will I remember Thee from the land of Jordan and Hermon, from the little mountain.
Deep calleth unto deep at the voice of Thy flood gates; all Thy billows and Thy waves have passed over me.
The Lord will command His mercy in the day time, and in the night His song shall be with me, my prayer unto the God of my life.
I will say unto God: Thou art my help; why hast Thou forgotten me? And why go I mourning while mine enemy afflictehth me?
When my bones were broken, mine enemies reproached me, when they daily said unto me: Where is thy God?
Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why dost thou trouble me? Hope thou in God, for I will give thanks unto Him; He is the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
