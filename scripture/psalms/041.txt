As the hart longeth after the springs of water, so longeth my soul after Thee, O God.
My soul thirsted for the mighty living God; when shall I come and appear before the face of God?
My tears have been my bread by day and by night, whilst they said to me daily: Where is thy God?
I remembered these things, and poured out my soul within me; for I will go to the place of the wondrous tabernacle, to the house of God, with a voice of rejoicing and thanksgiving, yea, of the sound of them that keep festival.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why dost thou disquiet me? Hope thou in God, for I will praise him; He is the salvation of my countenance and my God.
My soul hath been troubled within me; therefore will I remember Thee from the land of Jordan and Hermon, from the little mountain.
Deep calleth unto deep at the voice of Thy flood gates; all Thy billows and Thy waves have passed over me.
The Lord will command His mercy in the day time, and in the night His song shall be with me, my prayer unto the God of my life.
I will say unto God: Thou art my help; why hast Thou forgotten me? And why go I mourning whilst mine enemy oppresseth me?
While my bones were broken, mine enemies reproached me, while they said daily unto me: Where is thy God?
Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why dost thou disquiet me? Hope thou in God, for I will thanks unto Him; He is the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
