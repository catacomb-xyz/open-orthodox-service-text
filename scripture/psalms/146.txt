Praise the Lord, for psalmody is good; let praise be sweet unto our God.
The Lord doth build up Jerusalem; He gathereth together the dispersed of Israel.
He healeth the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds.
He telleth the multitude of the stars, and calleth them all by their name.
Great is our Lord, and great is His power; and of His understanding there is no measure.
The Lord lifteth up the meek, but casteth the wicked down to the ground.
Begin your song unto the Lord with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto God,
Who covereth the heavens with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth,
Who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains, and green herb for the service of man,
He giveth to the beasts their food, and to the young ravens which cry unto Him.
He shall not delight in the strength of a horse, nor in the legs of man is He well pleased.
The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear Him, and in those that hope in His mercy.
