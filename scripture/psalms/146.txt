Praise the Lord, for a psalm is good; let praise be pleasing unto our God.
The Lord buildeth up Jerusalem; the dispersed of Israel will he gather together.
He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.
He numbereth multitude of stars, and calleth to all of them by their names.
Great is the Lord our God, and great is his power, and of his understanding there is no measure.
The Lord lifteth up the meek, but casteth down the sinners to the ground.
Begin unto the Lord with confession; sing praises unto our God with harp,
To him who covereth the heavens with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow on mountains, and green herb for the service of men;
To him who giveth to the beasts their food, and to the young ravens which call upon him.
In the strength of the horse he will not delight, nor with the legs of the man will he be well pleased.
The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, and in those that hope in his mercy.
