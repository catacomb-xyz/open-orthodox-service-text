Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, he watcheth in vain that guard it.
It is vain for you to rise up early, to rouse yourselves after sitting down, ye who eat the bread of sorrow, while he hath given his beloved sleep.
Behold, sons are the inheritance of the Lord, the reward of the fruit of the womb.
Like arrows in the hands of a mighty man, so are the sons of them that were shaken out.
Blessed is he that shall satisfy his desires with them; they shall not be put to shame, whenever they may speak to their enemies in the gate.
