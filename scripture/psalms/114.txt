I have loved, for the Lord will hear the voice of my supplication.
For he hath inclined his ear unto me, and in my days I shall call upon him.
Throes of death have compassed me, and perils of hades have found me; I have found pain and sorrow, and upon the name of the Lord have I called, O Lord, deliver my soul.
Merciful is the Lord, and righteous, and our God showeth mercy.
The Lord keepeth watch over infants; I was brought low, and he saved me.
Turn back, O my soul, unto thy rest, for the Lord hath done good unto thee.
For he hath delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
I shall be well pleasing before the Lord in the land of the living.
