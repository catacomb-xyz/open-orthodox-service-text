I am filled with love, for the Lord will hear the voice of my supplication.
For He hath inclined His ear unto me, and I will call upon Him as long as I live.
The sorrows of death have compassed me, and the perils of hades have found me; I have found trouble and sorrow, and I called upon the Name of the Lord, O Lord, deliver my soul.
Merciful is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.
The Lord preserveth the infants; I was brought low, and He saved me.
Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.
For He hath delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
I will be well pleasing before the Lord, in the land of the living.
