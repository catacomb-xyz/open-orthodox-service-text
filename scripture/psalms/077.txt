Attend, O my people, to my law; incline your ear to the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter riddles from of old,
As many as we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
They were not hid from their children to another generation, declaring the praises of the Lord, and his mighty deeds, and his wonders that he hath done.
For he raised up a witness in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, as many as he commanded our fathers, to make them known unto their sons;
So that another generation to come might know them, sons which should be born; so shall they arise, and declare them unto their sons;
That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, and seek after his commandments;
That they might not be as their fathers, a crooked and provoking generation; a generation that made not its heart upright, and its spirit was not steadfast with God.
The sons of Ephraim, bending and shooting with bows, turned back in a day of battle.
They kept not the covenant of God, and were not minded to walk in his law.
And they forgot his benefits, and his wonders that he had showed them;
Wonders which he wrought before their fathers, in a land of Egypt, in a field of Tanis.
He rent asunder a sea, and led them through; he made waters stand as a wineskin.
And by day he led them with a cloud, and all night with a light of fire.
He cleaved a rock within wilderness, and gave them drink as in a great deep.
He brought water also out of a rock, and led down waters like rivers.
And they sinned yet more against him; they provoked the most High in a waterless land.
And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking food for their souls.
Yea, they spake against God, and said, Can God furnish a table in a wilderness?
Because he smote a rock, and waters gushed out, and rushing streams overflowed; can he give bread also? Or furnish a table for his people?
Therefore the Lord heard this, and did defer; so a fire was kindled in Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel.
Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation.
And he commanded clouds from above, and opened heaven's doors,
And he rained down manna upon them to eat, and gave unto them bread of heaven.
Bread of angels a man ate; he sent them provisions in fullness.
He removed a south wind from heaven, and brought on a southwest wind by his power,
He also rained flesh upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of seas,
And they fell in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
So they did eat, and were well filled, and their own desire he brought unto them.
They were not deprived from their desire, but while their meat was yet in their mouths,
The wrath of God rose against them, and slew the fattest among them, and fettered the chosen men of Israel.
In all these they sinned still, and believed not in his wonders.
Even their days did fail in vanity, and their years with haste.
When he slew them, then they sought him, and they returned, and rose early unto God.
And they remembered that God is their helper, and the most high God their redeemer.
Nevertheless they did love him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongue;
For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.
But he is merciful, and will be forgiving unto their sins, and will destroy them not; yea, he will increase to turn away his anger, and will not kindle all his wrath.
And he remembered that they are flesh; a breath that passeth away, and turneth not again.
How often did they provoke him in the wilderness; provoke him to wrath in a waterless land.
Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and stirred the Holy One of Israel.
They remembered not his hand, the day whereof he redeemed them from a hand of affliction.
How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in a field of Tanis.
And he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers that they might not drink.
He sent against them a tormenting fly, and it devoured them, and sent a frog, and it destroyed them.
He also gave their crops unto the rust, and their labours unto the locust.
He killed with hail their vine, and their mulberry trees with frost.
He gave their cattle also to hail, and their substance to the fire.
He sent against them the anger of his wrath; wrath and anger and affliction, a message by evil angels.
He made a path for his anger; he spared not their souls from death, and in death he enclosed their cattle.
And smote every firstborn in Egypt; first fruits of all their labour in the dwellings of Ham.
And took away his people like sheep, and guided them like a flock in a wilderness.
And he guided them in hope, and they feared not, but a sea covered over their enemies.
And he brought them into a mountain of his holiness, this mountain which his right hand had obtained.
And he cast out nations from before their face, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies,
And turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers; they were turned round into a crooked bow.
And they provoked him to anger among their hills, and with their graven images they provoked him to jealousy.
God heard, and regarded them no more, and greatly abhorred Israel.
And he drove away tabernacle at Shiloh, a tabernacle where he had dwelt among men.
And delivered their strength into captivity, and their beauty into hands of an enemy.
He shut up his people also with a sword, and regarded his inheritance no more.
Their young men were devoured by fire, and their maidens were not mourned.
Their priests fell by a sword, and their widows will not be lamented.
Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, as a mighty man that hath been heated with wine.
And he smote his enemies upon their backs; he gave them to an everlasting reproach.
And he cast aside the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim,
But chose the tribe of Judah; mount Sion which he loved.
And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns; he laid laid her foundation upon the earth unto the age.
He chose David also his servant, and took him from the flocks of the sheep.
From behind the ewes great with young he took him to shepherd Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance.
So he shepherded them in the innocence of his heart, and guided them by the knowledge of his hands.
