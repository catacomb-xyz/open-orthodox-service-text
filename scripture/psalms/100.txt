Mercy and judgment will I sing unto thee, O Lord.
I will chant, and have understanding in a blameless way. When wilt thou come unto me? I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house.
I have set no unlawful thing before mine eyes; I have hated them that trespass.
A crooked heart hath not cleaved unto me; of the wicked man who turned aside from me, I knew him not.
The man that speaketh against his neighbour in secret, him did I drive away; the man that hath a proud eye and an insatiable heart, with him I did not eat.
Mine eyes were upon the faithful of the land, that they might sit with me; the man that walketh in the blameless way, he would minister unto me.
He that worketh pride dwelt not within my house; he that telleth unrighteousness prospered not before mine eyes.
Morning by morning I slew all the sinners of the earth, utterly to destroy from the city of the Lord all them that work iniquity.
