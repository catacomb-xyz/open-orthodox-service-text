I will sing of mercy and judgment unto Thee, O Lord.
I will sing, and have understanding in a blameless way; when wilt Thou come unto me? I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house.
I have set no unlawful thing before mine eyes; I have hated the workers of iniquity.
The perverse heart cleaved not unto me, and I knew not the wicked man who turned from me.
The man that slandereth his neighbour in secret, him did I drive away from me; the man that hath a proud eye and an insatiable heart, with him would I not eat.
Mine eyes were upon the faithful of the land, that they might sit with me; the man that walketh in the blameless way, he shall serve me.
He that worketh pride dwelt not within my house; he that telleth lies prospered not before my sight.
In the morning I slew all the sinners of the land, utterly to destroy all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord.
