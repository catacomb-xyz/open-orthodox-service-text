Praise God in his saints; praise him in the firmament of his power.
Praise him for his mighty acts; praise him according to the multitude of his greatness.
Praise him with sound of trumpet; praise him with psaltery and harp.
Praise him with timbrel and dance; praise him with strings and flute.
Praise him with tuneful cymbals; praise him with loud cymbals of joy. Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord.
