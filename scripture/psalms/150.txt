Praise God in His saints; praise Him in the firmament of His power.
Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him according to the multitude of His greatness.
Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet; praise Him with the psaltery and harp.
Praise Him with the timbrel and dance; praise Him with strings and flute.
Praise Him with the tuneful cymbals; praise Him with high sounding cymbals of joy.
Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord.
