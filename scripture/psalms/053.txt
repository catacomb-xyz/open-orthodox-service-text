O God, in thy name save me, and in thy power judge me.
O God, hearken unto my prayer; give ear unto the words of my mouth.
For strangers rose up against me, and the mighty sought after my soul, and did not set God before them.
For behold, God helpeth me, and the Lord is the protector of my soul.
He shall return evils upon mine enemies; utterly destroy them in thy truth.
Willingly shall I sacrifice unto thee; I will confess thy Name, O Lord, for it is good.
For out of all my afflictions hast thou rescued me, and mine eye hath looked upon mine enemies.
