Save me, O God, by Thy Name, and judge me by Thy strength.
Hearken unto my prayer, O God; give ear unto the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me, and mighty men have sought my soul, and they have not set God before them.
For behold, God helpeth me, and the Lord is the protector of my soul.
He shall repay mine enemies for their evils; utterly destroy them in Thy truth.
Willingly shall I sacrifice unto Thee; I will praise Thy Name, O Lord, for it is good.
For Thou hast delivered me out of all my afflictions, and mine eye hath looked down upon mine enemies.
