O God, in thy name save me, and in thy strength do thou judge me.
O God, hear my prayer; give ear unto the words of my mouth.
For strangers have risen up against me, and the mighty have sought after my soul, and have not set God before them.
For behold, God helpeth me, and the Lord is he who upholdeth of my soul.
He shall return evils upon mine enemies; utterly destroy them in thy truth.
Willingly shall I sacrifice unto thee; I shall confess thy name, O Lord, for it is good.
For out of all mine afflictions hast thou rescued me, and mine eye hath looked out upon mine enemies.
