With endurance, I endured patiently for the Lord, and he gave heed unto me, and heard my supplication.
And he brought me up out from a pit of misery, and out from mire of clay; he set my feet upon a rock, and made my steps straight.
And he hath put a new song in my mouth, a hymn unto our God; many shall see it, and fear, and shall hope in the Lord.
Blessed is the man whose hope is in the name of the Lord, and looks not unto vanities and false madness.
Many are the wonders thou hast wrought, O Lord my God, and in thy thoughts there is none that shall be likened unto thee; I declared and I spake, They are multiplied beyond number.
Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire, but a body hast thou perfected for me; whole burnt offering and that for sins thou didst not seek.
Then I said, Behold, I have come; in a scroll of a book it is written of me,
That I should do thy will, O my God, and thy law in the midst of my heart.
I have preached righteousness in a great church; behold, I will not hold back my lips, O Lord, thou hast known.
Thy righteousness I did not hide within my heart; I spake of thy truth and thy salvation; I have not hid thy mercy, nor thy truth from a congregation of many.
But thou, O Lord, withhold not thy compassions from me; let thy mercy and thy truth ever support me.
For evils have compassed me about; mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, and I am not able to see; they are multiplied more than the hairs of mine head, and my heart hath forsaken me.
Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me; O Lord, give heed unto my help.
Let them be ashamed and confounded altogether that seek to take my soul away; let them wish me evil be turned backwards and put to shame.
Let them straightway receive shame for their reward, them that say unto me, Well done, well done!
Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee, O Lord, and let them that love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified.
But as for me, I am poor and needy, yet the Lord will be thoughtful for me; thou art my help and my shield, O my God, make no long tarrying.
