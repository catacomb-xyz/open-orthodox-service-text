Blessed are all they that feareth the Lord; that walketh in his ways.
Thou shalt eat the fruit of thy labours; blessed art thou, and well it shall be with thee.
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thy house; thy children like young olive trees round about thy table.
Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord.
The Lord bless thee out of Sion, and mayest thou see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
And mayest thou see thy children's children. Peace be upon Israel.
