I will confess Thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: and in the presence of angels will I sing unto Thee; for Thou hast heard all the words of my mouth.
I will worship toward Thy holy temple, and I will confess Thy Name on account of Thy mercy and Thy truth; for Thou hast magnified Thy holy Name above all that is.
In whatsoever day that I should call upon Thee, quickly hear me; in Thy power Thou shalt watch over me in my soul with great care.
Let all the kings of the earth confess Thee, O Lord, for they have heard all the words of Thy mouth.
Yea, let them sing in the ways of the Lord, for great is the glory of the Lord.
For the Lord is on high, yet He hath regard unto the lowly, but the haughty He knoweth afar off.
If I should walk in the midst of affliction, thou wilt make me to live; against the wrath of mine enemies thou hast stretched forth thy hand, and thy right hand hath saved me.
O Lord, Thou shalt recompense on behalf of me. Thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever; disdain not the works of Thy hands.
