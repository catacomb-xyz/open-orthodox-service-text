O give thanks unto the Lord, that he is good, that unto the age is his mercy.
Let them speak that have been redeemed by the Lord, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy,
From the lands he hath gathered them; from the east and from the west; from the north and from the sea.
They wandered in the wilderness, in a waterless land; they found not a way to a city of habitation.
Hungering and thirsting, their soul failed within them.
Then they cried unto the Lord in their affliction, and out of their distresses he delivered them.
And he led them by a straight way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
Let them give thanks unto the Lord for his mercies, and his wonders to the sons of men.
For he hath satisfied an empty soul, and filled a hungry soul with good things,
Those seated in darkness and in shadow of death, bound in poverty and iron.
For they rebelled against the sayings of God, and provoked the counsel of the most High.
Therefore their heart was humbled in labours; they were made weak, and there was none to help.
Then they cried unto the Lord in their affliction, and out of their distresses he saved them,
And he led them out of darkness and shadow of death; and broke their bonds asunder.
Let them give thanks unto the Lord for his mercies, and his wonders to the sons of men.
For he hath broken gates of brass, and cut in sunder bars of iron.
He took hold of them from their way of iniquity, for by their iniquity were they humbled.
Their soul abhorred all manner of food, and they drew near unto the gates of death.
Then they cried unto the Lord in their affliction, and out of their distresses he saved them.
He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their corruptions.
Let them give thanks unto the Lord for his mercies, and his wonders to the sons of men.
And let them sacrifice to him a sacrifice of praise, and make known his works with gladness.
They that go down to the sea in ships, that do their work in great waters,
These have seen the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.
He spake, and a wind of tempest stood, and lifted up the waves thereof.
They mount up to the heavens, and go down into the depths; their soul is melted in evils.
They were troubled, and staggered as the drunkard; all their wisdom was swallowed up.
Then they cried unto the Lord in their affliction, and out of their distresses he led them.
And he commanded the tempest, and it stood as a gentle wind, and the waves thereof kept silence.
Then were they glad, because they were stilled, so he brought them unto the haven of their will.
Let them give thanks unto the Lord for his mercies, and his wonders to the sons of men.
Let them exalt him in a church of people, and in a seat of elders praise him.
He made rivers into wilderness, and springs of waters into thirst,
Fruitful land into saltiness; for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
He made wilderness into pools of waters, and dry land into springs of waters.
And there he made men hungering to dwell, and they set together cities of habitation,
And they sowed fields, and planted vineyards, and they brought forth fruit of yield.
He blessed them also, so that they were multiplied greatly, and diminished not the number of their cattle.
Then they were made few, and vexed by affliction of evils and sorrow.
Contempt was poured upon their princes, and he caused them to wander in a place untrodden, where there is no way.
And he helped a poor man out of his poverty, and made his families as a flock.
The righteous shall see it, and rejoice, and all iniquity shall stop its mouth.
Who is wise, and will keep these things, and will understand the mercies of the Lord?
