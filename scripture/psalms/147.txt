Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Sion.
For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.
He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the fatness of wheat.
He sendeth forth his saying unto the earth; right swiftly runneth His word.
He giveth his snow like wool, and scattereth the mist like ashes.
He casteth his ice like crumbs of bread; who can stand before the face of his cold?
He shall send out his word, and melt them; his spirit shall blow, and the waters shall run.
He declareth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.
He hath not dealt so with every nation; and as for his judgements, he hath not revealed unto them.
