Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Sion.
For He hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; He hath blessed thy children within thee.
He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the fatness of wheat.
He sendeth forth His saying unto the earth; right swiftly runneth His word.
He giveth His snow like wool, and scattereth the mist like ashes.
He casteth His ice like crumbs of bread; who can stand before the face of His cold?
He shall send out His word, and melt them; His spirit shall blow, and the waters shall run.
He declareth His word unto Jacob, His statutes and His judgments unto Israel.
He hath not dealt so with every nation; and as for his judgements, He hath not revealed unto them.
