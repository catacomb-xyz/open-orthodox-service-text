Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Sion.
For He hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; He hath blessed thy children within thee.
He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the fatness of wheat.
He sendeth forth His saying unto the earth; right swiftly will His word run.
He giveth His snow like wool; He scattereth the mist like ashes.
He casteth forth His ice like morsels; who can stand before the face of His cold?
He shall send out His word, and melt them; His spirit shall blow, and the waters shall flow.
He declareth His word unto Jacob, His statutes and His judgments unto Israel.
He hath not dealt so with every nation, nor hath He shown His judgments unto them.
