A hymn becometh thee, O God, in Sion, and unto thee shall a vow be paid in Jerusalem.
Give heed unto my prayer; to thee shall all flesh come.
The words of the lawless have overcome us, but thou shalt be forgiving unto our own ungodliness.
Blessed is he whom thou hast chosen and taken unto thyself, for he shall have his tent in thy courts.
We shall be filled with the good things of thy house; holy is thy temple, wonderful in righteousness.
Hear us, O God our Saviour, Thou hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them that be far off at sea.
Who prepareth the mountains by Thy strength, being girded about with power; who troublest the hallow of the sea; as for the roar its waves, who shall withstand them?
The nations shall be troubled, and they that dwell in the uttermost parts shall be afraid at Thy signs; Thou shalt make to delight the goings out of morning and evening.
Thou hast visited the earth and watered it plenteously; Thou hast multiplied its wealth.
The river of God is filled with waters; Thou hast made ready their food, for thus is the preparation thereof.
Water its furrows abundantly, multiply its fruits; when they springeth up, they shall rejoice in its showers.
Thou shalt bless the crown of the year with Thy goodness, and Thy plains shall be filled with fatness.
The mountains of the wilderness shall be enriched, and the hills shall be girded with rejoicing.
The rams of the flock have clothed themselves with fleece, and the valleys shall abound with wheat; they shall cry aloud and shall sing.
