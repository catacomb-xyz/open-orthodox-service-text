A hymn becometh thee, O God, in Sion, and unto thee shall a vow be paid in Jerusalem.
Hear thou my prayer; unto thee shall all flesh come.
Words of transgressors have overcome us, but thou shalt be forgiving unto our own impieties.
Blessed is he whom thou hast chosen and taken unto thyself, for he shall have his tent in thy courts; we shall be filled with the good things of thy house; holy is thy temple.
Wonderful in righteousness, thou didst hear us, O God our Saviour, the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them that be far off at sea.
Who prepareth mountains in thy strength, being girded about with power.
Who troublest the hollow of the sea; as for the roar its waves, who shall withstand them?
The nations shall be troubled, and they that dwell in the uttermost parts shall be afraid at thy signs; thou shalt make to delight the goings out of morning and of evening.
Thou hast visited the earth and inebriated it; thou hast multiplied enriching it; the river of God is filled with waters; thou hast made ready their food, for thus is the preparation thereof.
Inebriate its furrows, multiply its fruits; when they springeth up, they shall rejoice in its showers.
Thou shalt bless the crown of the year with thy goodness, and thy plains shall be filled with fatness.
The seasonable things of the wilderness shall be made fat, and the hills shall be girded with rejoicing.
The rams of the flocks have clothed themselves with fleece, and the valleys shall multiply wheat; they shall cry out, for even they shall sing praise.
