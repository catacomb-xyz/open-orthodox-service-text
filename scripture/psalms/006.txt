O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, nor chasten me in thy wrath.
Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak; O Lord, heal me, for my bones are troubled.
My soul is also sore troubled; but thou, O Lord, how long?
Return, O Lord, deliver my soul; save me for thy mercy's sake.
For in death there is none to remember thee, and in hades who shall confess thee?
I have laboured with my groaning; every night will I wash my bed; I will water my couch with my tears.
Mine eye is troubled from anger; I have grown old among all mine enemies.
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.
The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord hath received my prayer.
Let all mine enemies be ashamed and troubled exceedingly; let them be turned back, and in haste, be exceedingly put to shame.
