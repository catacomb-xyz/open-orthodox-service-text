O God my God, unto thee do I rise early at dawn. My soul hath thirsted for thee; how my flesh hath longed for thee in a land barren and untrodden, where no water is.
So have I appeared before thee in the holy place, to behold thy power and thy glory.
Because thy mercy is better than lives, my lips shall praise thee.
So shall I bless thee in my life, and in thy name shall I lift up my hands.
As from marrow and fatness let my soul be filled, and my mouth shall praise thee with lips of rejoicing.
If I remembered thee upon my bed, in the morning I meditated on thee,
For thou hast become my helper; in the shelter of thy wings shall I rejoice.
My soul hath cleaved unto thee, and thy right hand hath upholden me.
But as for them, in vain they sought after my soul; they shall go into the lowest parts of the earth; they shall be given over to the power of the sword; they shall be portions for foxes.
But the king shall be glad in God; every one that sweareth by Him shall be praised, for the mouth of them that speak unjustly hath been stopped.
