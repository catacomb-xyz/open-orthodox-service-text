O Lord, I have cried unto thee, hear me; attend to the voice of my supplication when I cry unto thee.
Let my prayer be set forth as incense before Thee, the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and a door of enclosure round about my lips.
Incline not my heart unto words of evil, to make excuse with excuses in sins,
With men that work iniquity, and I shall not join with their chosen.
The righteous shall chasten me with mercy, and reprove me; but as for the oil of the sinner, let it not anoint my head.
For again and again is my prayer in the presence of their pleasures; swallowed up near by the rock have their judges been.
They shall hear my words, for they be sweetened; as a clod of earth is broken up upon the earth, so have their bones been scattered nigh unto hades.
For unto thee, Lord, O Lord, are mine eyes; in Thee have I hoped; take not my soul away.
Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and from the stumblingblocks of them that work iniquity.
The sinners shall fall into their own net; I am alone, until I pass by.
