O Lord, I have cried unto thee, hearken unto me; attend unto the voice of my supplication when I cry unto thee.
Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee, the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice.
Set, O Lord, a watch before my mouth, and a door of enclosure round about my lips.
Incline not my heart unto words of evil, to make excuse with excuses in sins; with men that work iniquity, and I shall not join with their chosen.
The righteous shall chasten me with mercy, and reprove me; as for oil of a sinner, let it not anoint my head, for yet still is my prayer in their pleasures.
Their judges have been swallowed up near by a rock; they shall hear my words, for they be sweetened.
As a clod of earth is broken up upon the earth, so have their bones been scattered nigh unto hades.
For unto thee, O Lord, O Lord, are mine eyes; in thee have I hoped; take not my soul away.
Keep me from a snare which they have made for me, and from stumbling blocks of them that work iniquity.
Sinners shall fall into their own net; I am alone, until I pass by.
