I was the smallest among my brethren, and the youngest in the house of my father; I did shepherd the sheep of my father.
My hands made an instrument, and my fingers fashioned a psaltery.
And who shall tell my Lord? The Lord Himself shall hearken.
He sent forth His angel, and took me from my fatherâ€™s flocks, and anointed me with the oil of His anointing.
My brethren were tall and fair, but the Lord took not pleasure in them.
I went forth to meet the stranger, but he cursed me by his idols.
But I drew his own sword and beheaded him, and took away the reproach from the children of Israel.
