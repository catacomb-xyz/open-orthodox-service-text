I was small among my brethren, and the youngest in my father's house; a shepherd of my father's sheep.
My hands made an instrument, and my fingers fashioned a psaltery. And who shall tell my Lord? The Lord himself, he himself shall hearken.
He sent forth his angel, and took me from my fatherâ€™s flocks, and anointed me with the oil of His anointing.
My brethren were tall and fair, yet the Lord took not pleasure in them.
I went forth to meet the stranger, and he cursed me by his idols.
But I drew his own sword and beheaded him, and took away the reproach from the sons of Israel.
