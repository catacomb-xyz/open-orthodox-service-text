I was small among my brethren, and the youngest in the house of my father; a shepherd of the sheep of my father.
My hands made an instrument, and my fingers fashioned a psaltery.
And who shall tell my Lord? The Lord himself, he himself shall attend.
He sent forth his angel, and took me from the sheep of my father, and anointed me with the oil of his anointing.
My brethren were tall and fair, yet the Lord took not pleasure in them.
I went forth to meet the stranger, and he cursed me by his idols.
But I drew his own sword and beheaded him, and removed reproach from the sons of Israel.
