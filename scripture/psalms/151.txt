I was small among my brethren, and the youngest in my father's house; a shepherd of my father's sheep.
My hands made an instrument, and my fingers fashioned a psaltery. And who shall tell my Lord? The Lord Himself shall hearken.
He sent forth His angel, and took me from my father’s flocks, and anointed me with the oil of His anointing.
My brethren were tall and fair, but the Lord took not pleasure in them.
I went forth to meet the stranger, but he cursed me by his idols.
But I drew his own sword and beheaded him, and removed reproach from the children of Israel.
