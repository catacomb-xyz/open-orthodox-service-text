Give ear unto my words, O Lord; consider thou my cry.
Attend unto the voice of my supplication, my king, and my God; for unto thee will I pray, O Lord.
My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I stand before thee, and thou shalt look upon me.
For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in iniquity; neither shall the evil doer dwell with thee,
Nor shall transgressors endure in thy sight; thou hast hated all workers of iniquity.
Thou shalt destroy all them that speak falsely; yea, the Lord abhorreth the bloody and deceitful man.
But as for me, I will enter into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy; in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Guide me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make straight my way before thee.
For there is no truth in their mouth; surely their heart is vanity; their throat is an open sepulchre; they deceived with their tongues.
Judge them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; according to the multitude of their very impieties cast them out, for they have embittered thee, O Lord.
But let all them that put their hope in thee be glad; they shall rejoice unto the age, and thou shalt dwell among them, and all they that love thy name shall glory in thee.
For thou wilt bless the righteous; O Lord, thou hast crowned us as with a shield of thy favour.
