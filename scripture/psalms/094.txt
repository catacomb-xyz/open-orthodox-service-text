O come, let us rejoice in the Lord; let us make a joyful noise unto God our saviour.
Let us be first before his face with confession, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.
For the Lord is a great God; a great king over all the earth.
For in his hand are the ends of the earth, and the highness of the mountains are his own.
For the sea is his, and he made it, and the dry land his hands fashioned.
O come, let us worship and fall down before him, and weep before the Lord who made us.
For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.
Today, if ye would hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, according to the day of the temptation in the wilderness,
When your fathers tempted me; they proved me and saw my works.
Forty years I loathed this generation, and said, They ever wander in heart, and have not known my ways.
So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.
