O come, let us rejoice in the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to God our Saviour.
Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto Him with psalms.
For the Lord is a great God, and a great King over all the earth.
For in His hand are the ends of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His also.
For the sea is His, and He made it; and His hands formed the dry land.
O come, let us worship and fall down before Him, and weep before the Lord that made us.
For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand.
Today if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, as in the day of temptation in the wilderness.
For your fathers tempted Me, proved Me, and saw My works.
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: Their hearts are always led astray, and they have not known My ways.
So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into My rest.
