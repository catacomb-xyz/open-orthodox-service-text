O come, let us rejoice in the Lord; let us make a joyful noise unto God our Saviour.
Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto Him with psalms.
For the Lord is a great God; a great King over all the earth.
In His hand are the ends of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are also His.
The sea is His, for He made it, and His hands formed the dry land.
O come, let us worship and fall down before Him, and weep before the Lord Who made us.
For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand.
Today, if ye would hear His voice: Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, according to the day of temptation in the wilderness,
When your fathers tempted Me; they proved Me and saw My works.
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known My ways.
So I swore in my wrath: They shall not enter into My rest.
