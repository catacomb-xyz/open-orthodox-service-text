Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, in the city of our God, in his holy mountain,
Well planted for the joy of all the earth, on mountains of Sion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great king.
God is known in her strongholds, when he cometh to her help.
For behold, the kings of the earth were assembled; they came together.
Having seen this they marvelled, they were troubled, they were shaken; trembling took hold upon them; there were pains as of a woman in travail.
With a vehement wind thou shalt break in pieces the ships of Tharsis.
As we have heard, so have we seen in a city of the Lord of powers, in a city of our God.
God hath laid her foundations unto the age.
We have taken up thy mercy, O God, in the midst of thy people.
According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth; thy right hand is full of righteousness.
Let the mountain of Sion be glad, and let the daughters of Judah rejoice, on account of thy judgments, O Lord.
Go round about Sion and embrace her; tell thereof in her towers.
Set your hearts upon her power, and number her palaces, that ye may tell thereof to another generation.
For he is our God unto the age, and unto the age of the age; he shall shepherd us unto the ages.
