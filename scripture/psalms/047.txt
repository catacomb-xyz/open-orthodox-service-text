Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, in the city of our God, in His holy mountain. Well planted, the joy of the whole earth,
On the mountains of Sion, on the sides of the north, is the city of the great King.
God is known in her palaces, when He cometh to her help.
For lo, the kings of the earth were assembled; they came together.
When they saw her so, they marvelled, they were troubled, they were shaken; trembling took hold upon them; there were pains as of a woman in travail.
With a violent wind shalt Thou shatter the ships of Tharsis.
As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God.
God hath laid her foundations for ever.
We have thought of Thy mercy, O God, in the midst of Thy people.
According to Thy Name, O God, so is Thy praise unto the ends of the earth; Thy right hand is full of righteousness.
Let the mountain of Sion rejoice, and let the daughters of Judah be glad, on account of Thy judgments, O Lord.
Go round Sion and encompass her; tell the towers thereof.
Set your hearts upon her strength, and consider her bulwarks, that ye may tell it to another generation.
For He is our God unto the age, and unto the age of age; He shall shepherd us unto the ages.
