With my voice have I cried unto the Lord, with my voice unto God, and he attended unto me.
In the day of mine affliction I sought after God, with my hands by night before him, and I was not deceived; my soul refused to be comforted.
I remembered God, and was made glad; I reasoned, and my spirit fainted away.
Mine eyes forestalled the watches; I was troubled and did not speak.
I considered the days of old, and I had in mind the everlasting years, and I meditated.
By night I communed with my heart, and searched with my spirit.
Surely the Lord will put away unto the ages? And will proceed no further to be well pleased?
Or will he cut off his mercy for ever? Hath he put to an end his word from generation to generation?
Or will God forget to be compassionate? Or in his wrath will he withhold his compassions?
And I said: Now have I made a beginning; this change is of the right hand of the most High.
I remembered the works of the Lord, for I shall remember thy wonders of old.
I shall meditate on all thy works, and in thy pursuits shall I ponder.
O God, in the sanctuary is thy way; who is so great a god as our God?
Thou art the God Who workest wonders; thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples.
Thou hast redeemed thy people with thy arm, the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and were afraid; the depths were troubled.
Great was the noise of the waters; the clouds gave forth voice, for thine arrows passed abroad.
The voice of thy thunder is in the wheel; thy lightnings gave light unto the world; the earth was shaken and made to tremble.
Thy ways are in the sea, and thy paths in many waters, and thy footsteps shall not be known.
Thou didst guide thy people like sheep by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
