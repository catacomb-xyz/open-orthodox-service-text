With my voice have I cried unto the Lord, with my voice unto God, and he attended unto me.
In a day of mine affliction I sought after God, with my hands by night before him, and I was not deceived; my soul refused to be comforted.
I remembered God, and was made glad; I reasoned, and my spirit fainted away.
Mine eyes kept vigil before watches; I was troubled and did not speak.
I considered days of old, and everlasting years I had in mind,
And I meditated; by night I communed with my heart, and searched diligently with my spirit.
Surely the Lord will put away unto the ages? And will proceed no further to be well pleased?
Or will he cut off his mercy for ever? Hath he put to an end his word from generation to generation?
Or will God forget to be compassionate? Or in his wrath will he withhold his compassions?
And I said, Now have I made a beginning; this change is of the right hand of the most High.
I remembered the works of the Lord, for I will remember thy wonders of old.
I will meditate on all thy works, and in thy pursuits will I ponder.
O God, in the holy place is thy way; who is so great a god as our God?
Thou art the God who workest wonders; thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples.
Thou hast redeemed thy people with thy arm, the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
Waters beheld thee, O God, waters beheld thee, and were afraid; the depths were troubled.
A multitude of sound of the waters; the clouds gave forth voice, for thine arrows passed abroad.
A voice of thy thunder is in the wheel; thy lightnings gave light unto the world; the earth was shaken and made to tremble.
Thy ways are in the sea, and thy paths in many waters, and thy footsteps shall not be known.
Thou didst guide thy people like sheep by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
