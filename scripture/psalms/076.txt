With my voice unto the Lord have I cried, with my voice unto God, and He gave ear unto me.
In the day of mine affliction I sought God, with my hands lifted up by night before Him, and I was not deceived; my soul refused to be comforted.
I remembered God, and rejoiced; I reasoned, and my spirit fainted.
Mine eyes guarded the night watches; I was so troubled I could not speak.
I considered the days of old, and the everlasting years I called to rememberance, and I meditated.
By night I communed with my heart, and my spirit made diligent search.
Will the Lord cast me off unto the ages? And will He be favourable no more?
Or will He cut utterly off His mercy? Hath he put to an end that which is spoken from generation to generation?
Or will God forget to be compassionate, or in his anger will He shut up His compassions?
And I said: Now have I made a beginning; this change is of the right hand of the Most High.
I remembered the works of the Lord, for I will be mindful of Thy wonders of old.
I will meditate on all Thy works, and consider Thy ways.
Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary; who is so great a god as our God? Thou art the God Who workest wonders.
Thou hast made known Thy strength among the nations; with Thine arm Thou hast redeemed Thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
The waters saw Thee, O God, the waters saw Thee, and were afraid; the depths were troubled.
Great was the noise of the waters; the clouds gave forth voice, for Thine arrows went abroad.
The voice of Thy thunder was in their rolling, and Thy lightnings gave light unto the world; the earth was shaken and made to tremble.
Thy ways are in the sea, and Thy paths in many waters, and Thy footsteps shall not be known.
Thou didst guide Thy people like sheep by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
