How beloved are Thy dwellings, O Lord of hosts. My soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God.
Yea, the sparrow hath found herself a house, and the turtledove a nest for herself where she may lay her young; so also do I long for Thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house; they shall praise Thee for ever and ever.
Blessed is the man whose help is from Thee; in his heart he hath established ascents in the vale of tears, in the place which he hath appointed.
For the lawgiver shall give blessings; they shall go from strength to strength; the God of gods shall be seen in Sion.
O Lord God of hosts, hearken unto my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob.
Behold, O God our defender, and look upon the face of thy christ.
For better is one day in Thy courts than thousands elsewhere. I have chosen to be an outcast in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of sinners.
For God loveth mercy and truth; the Lord will give grace and glory. No good thing will the Lord withhold from them that walk in innocence.
O Lord God of hosts, blessed is the man that hopeth in Thee.
