How beloved are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts. My soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God.
Yea, the sparrow hath found itself a home, and the turtledove a nest for herself, wherewith she may lay her young; even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house; they shall praise thee unto the ages of ages.
Blessed is the man whose support is from thee; he hath arrayed in his heart ascents, in the vale of tears, in the place which he hath set.
For even the lawgiver shall give blessings; they shall go from strength to strength; the God of gods shall be seen in Sion.
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob.
Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thy christ.
For better is one day in thy courts than thousands. I have chosen to be an outcast in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the tents of sinners.
For God loveth mercy and truth; the Lord shall give grace and glory. The Lord shall not withold good things from them that walk in innocence.
O Lord God of hosts, blessed is the man that hopeth in thee.
