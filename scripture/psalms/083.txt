How beloved are thy tabernacles, O Lord of powers.
My soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh have rejoiced in a living God.
For even a sparrow hath found itself a home, and a turtledove a nest for herself, wherewith she may lay her young; even thine altars, O Lord of powers, my King and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house; they shall praise thee unto the ages of the ages.
Blessed is a man whose support is from thee; he hath arrayed in his heart ascents, in the vale of tears, in the place which he hath set.
For even the lawgiver shall give blessings; they shall go from strength to strength; the God of the gods shall be seen in Sion.
O Lord God of powers, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob.
Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thy christ.
For better is one day in thy courts than thousands.
I have chosen to be an outcast in the house of my God, rather than to dwell among tents of sinners.
For God loveth mercy and truth; the Lord shall give grace and glory; the Lord shall not withold good things from them that walk in innocence.
O Lord God of powers, blessed is a man that hopeth in thee.
