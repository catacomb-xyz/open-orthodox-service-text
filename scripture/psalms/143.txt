Blessed be the Lord my God, who teacheth my hands for battle, and my fingers for war.
My mercy and my refuge; my support and my deliverer; my shield, and in him did I hope; who subdueth my people under me.
O Lord, what is man, that thou art made known to him? Or a son of man, that thou takest account of him?
Man is like unto vanity; his days are as a shadow that passeth away.
Incline the heavens, O Lord, and come down; touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
Cast forth lightning, and thou shalt scatter them; send out thine arrows, and thou shalt trouble them.
Send thy hand from above; rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of sons of strangers;
Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and whose right hand is a right hand of iniquity.
O God, unto thee will I sing a new song; upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee;
Who givest salvation unto kings; who redeemest thy servant David from an evil sword.
Rescue and deliver me from the hand of sons of strangers, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and whose right hand is a right hand of iniquity;
Whose sons are as new trees, settled in their youth; their daughters made beautiful, adorned round about in likeness of a temple;
Their treasuries full, pouring forth from one to another; their sheep fruitful with young, multiplying in their outward goings.
So are their oxen fat; there is no breach of wall, nor passage, nor crying out in their streets.
They have called the people blessed to which fareth thus, but blessed be the people whose God is the Lord.
