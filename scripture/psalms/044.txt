My heart hath poured forth a good word; I speak of my works unto the King. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured upon Thy lips; therefore God hath blessed Thee for ever.
Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O mighty one, in Thy comeliness and in Thy beauty.
And bend thy bow, and prosper, and reign, because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and Thy right hand shall guide Thee wondrously.
Thine arrows, O mighty one, having been made sharp, are in the hearts of the enemies of the King; the peoples shall fall under Thee.
Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the sceptre of Thy kingdom is a sceptre of uprightness.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness; therefore God, thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness beyond thy companions.
Myrrh and aloes and cassia perfume Thy garments, and out of the ivory palaces; whereby they have made Thee glad, the daughters of kings in Thy honour.
Upon Thy right hand did the queen stand, clothed in raiment of woven gold, arrayed in many colours.
Hearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thine ear; forget thine own people, and thy father's house.
For the King shall greatly desire thy beauty, for He is thy Lord, and thou shalt worship Him.
And the daughters of Tyre shall bow down to Him with gifts; the rich among the people shall entreat thy countenance.
All the glory of the Kingâ€™s daughter is within; with gold fringed garments is she arrayed, wrought about with many colours.
The virgins that follow her shall be brought unto the King; those near to her shall be brought unto Thee.
They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing; they shall be brought into the temple of the King.
In the place of thy fathers, sons are born to thee; thou shalt make them princes over all the earth.
I will remember thy name in all generations. Therefore shall the peoples praise thee for ever, and unto the ages of ages.
