My heart hath poured forth a good word; I speak of my works unto the king; my tongue is a scribe's pen that writeth swiftly.
Flourishing in beauty beyond the sons of men, grace was poured out upon thy lips; therefore God hath blessed thee unto the age.
Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, in thy comeliness and in thy beauty,
And bend thy bow, and prosper, and be king, on account of truth and meekness and righteousness, and thy right hand shall guide thee wondrously.
Thine arrows are sharp, O mighty one, sharp in the heart of the enemies of the king; peoples shall fall under thee.
Thy throne, O God, is unto the age of the age; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with an oil of gladness above thy fellows.
Myrrh and aloes and cassia perfume thy garments, from ivory palaces whereby they have made thee glad.
Daughters of kings are in thy honour; the queen stood at thy right hand, clothed in golden raiment, arrayed in many colours.
Hear, O daughter, and see, and incline thine ear; forget thine own people, and the house of thy father.
For the king shall desire thy beauty, for he is thy Lord, and thou shalt worship him.
And daughters of Tyre shall bow down to him with gifts; the rich among the people shall entreat thy face.
All the glory of the kingâ€™s daughter is within, clothed with golden fringes,
Arrayed in many colours; virgins that follow after her shall be brought unto the king; those near to her shall be brought unto thee.
They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing; they shall be brought into a king's temple.
In the place of thy fathers, sons are born to thee; thou shalt appoint them princes over all the earth.
I will remember thy name in in every generation and generation. Therefore shall the peoples confess thee unto the age, and unto the age of the age.
