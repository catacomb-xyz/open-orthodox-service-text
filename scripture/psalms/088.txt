I will sing of thy mercies, O Lord, unto the age; with my mouth will I declare thy truth unto generation and generation.
For thou hast said, Mercy shall be built up unto the age; in the heavens shall thy truth be prepared.
I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant.
Until the age will I prepare thy seed, and build up thy throne unto generation and generation.
The heavens shall confess thy wonders, O Lord; thy truth also in a church of saints.
For who in the clouds shall be equal unto the Lord? And who among sons of God shall be likened unto the Lord?
God, who is glorified in a council of saints; great and fearful to all those round about him.
O Lord God of the powers, who is like unto thee? Mighty art thou, O Lord, and thy truth round about thee.
Thou rulest the strength of the sea; the tossing of the waves thereof thou dost calm.
Thou hast brought low a proud one as if slain; with the arm of thy power thou hast scattered thine enemies.
Thine are the heavens, and thine is the earth; the world and the fullness thereof thou hast founded.
The north and seas hast thou created; Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy Name.
Thine is the arm with power. Let thy hand be strengthened; let thy right hand be exalted.
Righteousness and judgment are the preparation of thy throne; mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
Blessed is the people that knoweth a shout of joy; they shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance,
And in thy name shall they rejoice all the day, and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
For thou art the glory of their strength, and in thy favour shall our horn be exalted,
For the support is of the Lord, and of the Holy One of Israel, our king.
Then thou spakest in vision to thy sons, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one chosen of my people.
I have found David My servant, with my holy oil have I anointed him.
For my hand shall support him, and mine arm shall strengthen him.
An enemy shall not profit by him, nor shall a son of iniquity add to harm him.
And I will cut down his foes before his face, and put them to flight that hate him.
And my truth and my mercy shall be with him, and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
I will set his hand also in a sea, and his right hand in rivers.
He shall call upon me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the support of my salvation.
And I will make him My firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.
Unto the age will I keep my mercy for him, and my covenant shall be faithful unto him.
And I will establish his seed unto the age of the age, and his throne shall be as the days of heaven.
If his sons should forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
If they should defile my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
Then will I visit their iniquities with a rod, and their unrighteousness with scourges;
But my mercy I will never disperse from them, nor will I do wrong in my truth.
Neither will I defile my covenant, and what proceedeth by my lips, I shall not despise.

Once have I sworn by My holiness, that I will not lie unto David.
His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before Me, and as the moon that is established for ever, and as a faithful witness in heaven.
But Thou hast cast off and abhorred; Thou wast angered with thy christ.
Thou hast overturned the covenant of Thy servant; Thou hast profaned his sanctuary to the ground.
Thou hast broken down all his hedges; Thou hast put fear in his strongholds.
All that pass by the way spoil him; he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
Thou hast set up the right hand of them that afflict him, Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
Thou hast turned back the help of his sword, and hast not helped him in battle.
Thou hast made an end of his purification; Thou hast cast his throne down to the ground.
Thou hast made short the days of his time; Thou hast covered him with shame.
How long, O Lord? Wilt Thou hide Thyself for ever? Shall Thy wrath be kindled like fire?
Remember what is my substance; for hast Thou created all the sons of man in vain?
What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? Shall he deliver his soul out of the hand of hades?
O Lord, where are Thine mercies of old, which Thou didst swear unto David in Thy truth?
Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Thy servants, which I have endured in my bosom from many nations.
Wherewith Thine enemies have reproached, O Lord; wherewith they have reproached the exchange of thy christ.
Blessed be the Lord for evermore. So be it. So be it.
