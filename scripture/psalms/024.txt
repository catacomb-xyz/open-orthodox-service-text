Unto Thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul.
O my God, I have trusted in Thee, let me never be put to shame; neither let mine enemies laugh me to scorn.
Yea, let none that wait on Thee be put to shame; let them be ashamed which are lawless without cause.
Show me Thy ways, O Lord, and teach me Thy paths.
Lead me in Thy truth and teach me, for Thou art God my Saviour; for on Thee have I waited all the day long.
Remember Thy compassions, O Lord, and Thy lovingkindnesses; for they are from everlasting.
Remember not the sin and ignorance of my youth; according to Thy mercy remember Thou me, on account of Thy goodness, O Lord.
Good and upright is the Lord; therefore will He give a law to sinners in the way.
He will guide the meek in judgment; He will teach the the meek His ways.
All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth, unto them that seek after His covenant and witnesses.
For Thy Name's sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.
What man is he that feareth the Lord? He shall set him a law in the way that He hath chosen.
His soul shall dwell among good things, and his seed shall inherit the earth.
The Lord is the strength of them that fear Him, and His covenant shall be revealed to them.
Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord, for He shall draw out my feet from the snare.
Look Thou upon me, and have mercy on me; for I am one only begotten and poor.
The sorrows of my heart were multiplied; bring me out from my tribulations.
Look upon my lowliness and my toil, and forgive all my sins.
Look upon mine enemies, for they are multiplied; with an unjust hatred have they hated me.
Keep my soul, and deliver me; let me not be put to shame, for I have put my trust in Thee.
The innocent and the upright have cleaved unto me, for I have waited on Thee, O Lord.
Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his afflictions.
