O God, who shall be likened unto thee? Be thou not silent, nor make to be appeased, O God.
For lo, thine enemies have roared, and they that hate thee have lifted up their head.
Against thy people have they devised wicked judgement, and have taken counsel together against thy saints.
They said: Come, let us utterly destroy them, that they be no more a nation, and the name of Israel be no more remembered.
For they have consulted together in oneness of mind; they have made a covenant against thee; even the tents of the Edomites, and the Ishmaelites,
Moab, and the Hagarenes, Naibal, and Ammon, and Amalek, and the foreigners with them that dwell at Tyre.
Yea, and Assur also is joined with them; they came to be a help for the sons of Lot.
Do unto them as unto Midian and Sisera, as unto Jabin at the brook of Kishon.
They were destroyed utterly at Endor, they became as dung for the earth.
Make their rulers like Oreb, and Zeeb, and Zebah, and Zalmunna; yea, all their rulers who said: Let us take to ourselves for an inheritance the sanctuary of God.
Make them like a wheel, O my God, as stubble before the face of the wind;
As fire that burneth the wood, as a flame that consumeth the mountains.
So shalt thou pursue them with thy tempest, and confound them in thy wrath.
Fill their faces with dishonour, and they shall seek thy name, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and troubled unto the age of the age; yea, let them be put to shame and perish,
And let them know that thy name is Lord; thou alone art Most High over all the earth.
