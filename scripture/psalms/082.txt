O God, who shall be likened unto thee? Keep not thy silence, neither be thou still, O God.
For behold, thine enemies have roared, and they that hate thee have lifted up their head.
Against thy people have they devised wicked judgement, and have taken counsel together against thy saints.
They said, Come, let us utterly destroy them from being a nation, and the name of Israel shall be no more remembered.
For they have consulted together in oneness of mind; they have made a covenant against thee;
The tents of the Edomites, and the Ishmaelites,
Moab, and the Hagarenes,
Naibal, and Ammon, and Amalek, and the foreigners with them that dwell at Tyre.
Yea, and Assur also came together with them; they came to be a help for the sons of Lot.
Do unto them as unto Midian and Sisera, as unto Jabin at the brook of Kishon.
They were destroyed utterly at Endor, they became as dung for the earth.
Make their rulers like Oreb, and Zeeb, and Zebah, and Zalmunna; all their rulers who said, Let us take to ourselves the holy place of God for an inheritance.
Make them like a wheel, O my God, as stubble before wind;
As fire which shall burn a wood, as a flame that shall consume mountains.
So shalt thou pursue them with thy tempest, and confound them in thy wrath.
Fill their faces with dishonour, and they shall seek thy name, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and troubled unto the age of the age; yea, let them be put to shame and perish,
And let them know that thy name is Lord; thou alone art most high over all the earth.
