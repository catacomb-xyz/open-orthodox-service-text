O God, who shall be likened unto Thee? Hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O God.
For behold, Thine enemies have made a noise, and they that hate Thee have lifted up the head.
Against Thy people have they taken wicked counsel, and have conspired against Thy saints.
They have said: Come, let us utterly destroy them, that they be no more a nation, and let the name of Israel be remembered no more.
For they have consulted together in unity together; they have made a covenant against Thee.
The tents of the Edomites and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites,
Naibal and Ammon and Amalek, and the foreigners with them that dwell at Tyre.
Yea, Assur also is come with them; they are become a help for the children of Lot.
Do unto them as Thou didst unto Midian and Sisera, as to Jabin at the brook of Kishon.
They were destroyed at Endor, they became as dung for the earth.
Make their princes like Oreb and Zeeb, and Zebah and Zalmunna; yea, all their princes,
Who said: Let us take to ourselves the sanctuary of God for an inheritance.
O my God, make them like a wheel, as the stubble before the face of the wind,
As the fire that shall burn the forest, as the flame that shall consume the mountains.
So shalt Thou pursue them with Thy tempest, and trouble them in Thy wrath.
Fill their faces with dishonour, and they shall seek Thy Name, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and troubled for ever and ever, and let them be confounded and destroyed.
And let them know that Thy Name is Lord; Thou alone art Most High over all the earth.
