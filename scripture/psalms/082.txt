O God, who shall be likened unto Thee? Hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O God.
For behold, Thine enemies have made a noise, and they that hate Thee have lifted up their head.
Against Thy people have they taken wicked counsel, and have conspired against Thy saints.
They have said: Come, let us utterly destroy them, that they may no more be a nation, and the name of Israel may no more be remembered.
For they have consulted in unity together; they have made a covenant against Thee.
The tents of the Edomites, and the Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagarenes,
Naibal, and Ammon, and Amalek, and the foreigners with them that dwell at Tyre.
Yea, and Assur also is joined with them; they came to be a help for the children of Lot.
Do unto them as Thou didst unto Midian and Sisera, as with Jabin at the brook of Kishon.
They were destroyed at Endor, they became as dung for the earth.
Make their rulers like Oreb, and Zeeb, and Zebah, and Zalmunna; yea, all their rulers who said: Let us take to ourselves the sanctuary of God for an inheritance.
O my God, make them like a wheel, as stubble before the face of the wind,
As fire that burneth the forest, as a flame that consumeth the mountains.
So shalt Thou pursue them with Thy tempest, and trouble them in Thy wrath.
Fill their faces with dishonour, and they shall seek Thy Name, O Lord.
Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish;
And let them know that Thy Name is Lord; Thou alone art Most High over all the earth.
