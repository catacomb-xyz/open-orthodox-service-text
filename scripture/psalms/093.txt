The Lord is the God of vengeances; the God of vengeances spake out with boldness.
Be lifted up, thou who judgest the earth; render the proud their due.
How long shall sinners, O Lord, how long shall sinners boast?
Shall they utter and speak unrighteousness? How shall they speak, all they that work iniquity?
Thy people, O Lord, have they brought low, and have wronged thine inheritance.
Widow and orphan have they slain, and the stranger have they murdered.
Yet they have said: The Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob understand.
Understand then, ye senseless among the people, and ye fools, at length be wise.
He that shaped the ear, doth he not hear? Or he that formed the eye, doth he not see?
He that chastiseth the heathen, doth he not rebuke? He that teacheth man knowledge?
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men, that they are vanity.
Blessed is the man whom thou chastise, O Lord, and teach out of thy law,
To give him rest from the days of adversity, until a pit be dug for the sinner.
For the Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance,
Until righteousness return unto judgment, and all the upright in heart abide by it.
Who shall arise for me against them that do evil? Or who will stand with me against the workers of iniquity?
Unless the Lord had been my help, my soul would have sojourned in hades.
If I were to say: My foot hath been shaken; thy mercy, O Lord, would hath helped me.
According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, thy comforts brought gladness unto my soul.
Let not the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which fashioneth trouble by command.
They shall hunt for the soul of the righteous, and innocent blood shall they condemn.
But the Lord is become my refuge, and my God the helper of my hope.
And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and according to their own wickedness shall the Lord God make them to be seen no more.
