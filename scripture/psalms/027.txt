Unto Thee, O Lord, have I cried; O my God, be not silent unto me, lest if thou be silent unto me, I become like them that go down into the pit.
Hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication, when I pray unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy temple.
Draw me not in with the wicked, and destroy me not with them that work iniquity,
Who speak peace to their neighbours, but evil is in their hearts.
Give unto them, O Lord, according to their works, and according to the iniquity of their own pursuits; give unto them after the works of their hands; render unto them their due reward.
For they have not understood the works of the Lord, nor the works of his hands. Thou shalt destroy them, and shalt not build them up.
Blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplication.
The Lord is my helper and defender. My heart hath hoped in him, and I am given help; my flesh hath flourished anew, and out of my desire shall I confess unto him.
The Lord is the strength of his people, and the defender of the salvation of his christ.
Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance; shepherd them, and lift them up unto the age.
