Unto thee, O Lord, have I cried; O my God, be not silent unto me, lest if thou be silent unto me, I become like them that go down into a pit.
Hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication, when I pray unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy temple.
Draw me not together with sinners, and destroy me not with them that work iniquity,
Who speak peace to their neighbours, but evil is in their hearts.
Give unto them, O Lord, according to their works, and according to the iniquity of their own pursuits; give unto them after the works of their hands; render unto them their due reward.
For they have not understood the works of the Lord, nor the works of his hands. Thou shalt destroy them, and shalt not build them up.
Blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplication.
The Lord is my help and my shield; my heart hath hoped in him, and I am helped, and my flesh hath flourished anew; out of my desire will I confess unto him.
The Lord is strength for his people, and a shield of the salvation of his christ.
Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance; shepherd them, and lift them up unto the age.
