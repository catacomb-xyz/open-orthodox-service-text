Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord.
O Lord, hear my voice; let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.
If thou, O Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
For with thee there is forgiveness.
For thy name's sake have I waited for thee, O Lord; my soul hath waited for thy word.
My soul hath hoped in the Lord, from morning watch until night, from morning watch.
Let Israel hope in the Lord; for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him there is plenteous redemption.
And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
