Out of the depths have I cried unto Thee, O Lord; O Lord, hearken unto my voice.
Let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.
If Thou, O Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
But with Thee there is forgiveness.
For Thy Name's sake have I patiently waited for Thee, O Lord; my soul hath patiently waited for Thy word; my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
From the morning watch until the night, from the morning watch, let Israel hope in the Lord.
For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption, and He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
