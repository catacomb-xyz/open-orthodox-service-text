Have mercy on me, O God, for man tramples upon me; all the day long he wages war and oppresses me.
Mine enemies trample on me all the day long, for they be many that fight against me from on high.
By day I will not fear, but I will hope in Thee.
In God I will praise my words, in God I have put my hope; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
All the day long they abhorred my words; all their thoughts were against me for evil.
They will dwell near and hide themselves; they will watch where I set my heel, even as they have waited for my soul.
By no account shalt Thou save them; in anger shalt Thou cast down the peoples, O God.
My life have I declared unto Thee; Thou hast set my tears before Thee.
Even as Thou hast promised, mine enemies shall be turned back. In the day that I call upon Thee, behold, I know that Thou art God.
In God will I render praise to His word; in the Lord will I render praise to His speech.
In God have I put my hope; I will not fear what man can do unto me.
Thy vows are upon me, O God, which I will render in praise of Thee.
For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling; that I may be well pleasing before the Lord in the light of the living.
