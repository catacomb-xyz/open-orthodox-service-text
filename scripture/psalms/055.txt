Have mercy on me, O God, for man hath trodden me under foot; making war all the day long he hath afflicted me.
Mine enemies have trodden me down all the day long, for many are they that make war against me from on high.
I will not be afraid by day, for I will hope in thee.
In God will I praise my words; in God have I put my hope; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
All the day long they abhorred my words; all their thoughts were against me for evil.
They shall dwell near and hide themselves; they shall watch where I set my heel, even as they have waited for my soul.
On no account shalt thou save them; in anger thou shalt cast down peoples.
O God, my life have I made known unto thee; thou hast set my tears before thee, as also in thy promise.
Mine enemies shall be turned back in the day that I call upon thee; behold, I know that thou art my God.
In God will I praise by speech; in the Lord will I praise by word.
In God have I put my hope; I shall not fear what man can do unto me.
In me, O God, are vows which I will render in praise of thee.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling, that I may be well pleasing before God in the light of the living.
