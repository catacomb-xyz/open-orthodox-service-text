Judge thou, O Lord, them that do me injustice; war against them that war against me.
Take hold of weapon and shield, and arise to my help.
Draw forth a sword, and close in against them that pursue me; say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.
Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul; let them be turned back and brought to confusion that reason evils against me.
Let them be as dust before the face of the wind, and let an angel of the Lord afflict them.
Let their way be dark and a sliding, and an angel of the Lord pursuing them.
For without cause have they hid for me the corruption of their snare; in vain have they reproached my soul.
Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him, and let the net that he hath hid catch himself; into that very snare let him fall.
But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; it shall delight in his salvation.
All my bones shall say, Lord, O Lord, who is like unto thee? Who deliverest the poor from the hand of them stronger than he; yea, the poor and the needy from them that despoileth him?
Unjust witnesses did rise up against me, asking me things that I knew not.
They rewarded me evil for good, and with barrenness for my soul.
But as for me, when they troubled me, I put on sackcloth, and humbled my soul with fasting, and my prayer shall return into mine own bosom.
As to a neighbour, as to our brother, so was I well pleasing; as one mourning and sorrowful, so was I humbled.
Yet against me they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together; scourges were gathered together upon me, and I knew it not. They were cut asunder, and yet not pierced.
They tried me, they mocked me with mockery, they gnashed their teeth upon me.
O Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? Rescue my soul from their malice, mine only begotten from lions.
I will confess thee in a great church; among a burdensome people will I praise thee.
Let not them rejoice over me that are mine enemies unjustly, that hate me without a cause and wink with their eyes.
For unto me they spake peaceably, but in wrath they devised deceits.
Yea, they widened their mouth wide against me; they said, It is well, it is well, our eyes have seen it.
This thou hast seen, O Lord, be thou not silent; O Lord, depart not from me.
Rise up, O Lord, and take heed unto my judgment; even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.
Judge me, O Lord, according to thy righteousness; O Lord my God, let them not rejoice over me.
Let them not say in their hearts, It is well, it is well, for our soul! Neither let them say, We have swallowed him up.
Let them be ashamed and confounded together that rejoice at my hurt. Let them be clothed with shame and confusion that boast against me.
Let them rejoice and be glad that desire for my righteousness, and let them say continually, The Lord be magnified.
And my tongue shall meditate on thy righteousness and thy praise all the day long.
