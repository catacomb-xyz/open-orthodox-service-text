Hear this, all ye nations; give ear, all ye that inhabit the world;
Both them born of earth and the sons of men; rich and poor together.
My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart understanding.
I shall incline mine ear to a parable; I shall lay open my problem upon the harp.
Wherefore should I fear in the day of evil? The iniquity at my heel shall compass me about,
They that trust in their power, and boast themselves in the multitude of their wealth.
A brother doth not redeem; shall a man redeem?
He shall not give to God a ransom for himself, nor the price of the redemption of his soul; he hath laboured unto the age, and he shall live unto the end,
For he shall not see corruption, whenever he seeth wise men die.
Altogether the senseless and the fool shall perish, and leave their wealth to strangers,
And their graves shall be their homes unto the age, their dwelling places unto generation and generation; they called their lands after their own names.
And man, being in honour, understood not; he is like the mindless cattle, and is become like unto them.
This way of theirs is a stumblingblock unto them, and afterwards they shall be well pleased with their mouth.
Like sheep they are laid in hades; death shall be their shepherd, and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning, and their help shall wax old in hades; they have been cast out from their glory.
But God will redeem my soul out of the hand of hades, whensoever he receiveth me.
Be not afraid when a man is made rich, or when the glory of his house is multiplied;
For when he dieth, he shall carry nothing away, nor shall his glory descend with him.
For his soul shall be blessed in his life; he shall confess unto thee when thou shalt do good unto him.
He shall enter as far as the generation of his fathers; he shall not see light unto the age.
And man, being in honour, understood not; he is like the mindless cattle, and is become like unto them.
