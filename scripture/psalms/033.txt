I will bless the Lord at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth.
In the Lord shall my soul be praised; let the meek hear and be glad.
O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.
I sought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my tribulations.
Come unto him and be enlightened; and your faces shall not be ashamed.
This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his tribulations.
An angel of the Lord shall encamp round about them that fear him, and will deliver them.
O taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man that hopeth in him.
O fear the Lord, all ye his saints; for there is no want to them that fear him.
The rich have turned poor and gone hungry; but they that seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good thing.
Come, O ye children, hearken unto me; I shall teach you the fear of the Lord.
What man is he that desireth life, that loveth to see good days?
Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears toward their supplication.
But the face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
The righteous cried, and the Lord heard them, and delivered them out of all their tribulations.
The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and the humble in spirit he shall save.
Many are the tribulations of the righteous, but out of them all will the Lord deliver them.
The Lord keepeth all their bones; not one of them shall be broken.
The death of sinners is evil, and they that hate the righteous shall do wrong.
The Lord shall redeem the souls of his servants, and all they that hope in him shall in no way do wrong.
