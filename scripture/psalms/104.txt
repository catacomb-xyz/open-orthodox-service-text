O give thanks unto the Lord, and call upon his name; make known his deeds among the nations.
Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him; tell of all his wonders.
Be praised in his holy name; let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.
Seek the Lord, and be made strong; seek his face evermore.
Remember his wonders which he hath wrought; his marvels, and the judgments of his mouth.
O ye seed of Abraham his servants, ye sons of Jacob his chosen.
He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
He hath remembered his covenant unto the age, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,
Which he hath made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac,
And confirmed the same unto Jacob for an ordinance, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,
Saying: Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance.
When they were small in number; yea, very few, and strangers therein,
And they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people.
He suffered no man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved kings for their sake;
Saying, Touch not my christs, and do my prophets no evil.
Moreover he called for a famine upon the land; he broke the whole staff of bread.
He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant.
Whose feet they humbled with fetters; his life was spent in irons,
Until his word came; the word of the Lord tried him as fire.
The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.
He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance,
To chasten his princes as he himself, and to give his elders wisdom.
And Israel went into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
And he increased his people greatly, and made them strong above their enemies.
He turned their heart to hate his people; to deal deceitfully with his servants.
He sent forth Moses His servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen.
He put his signs among them, and his marvels in the land of Ham.
He sent out darkness, and made it dark; for they made bitter his words.
He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.
He spake, and there came tormenting flies, and gnats in all their borders.
He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
And he smote their vines and their fig trees, and broke all every tree of their border.
He spake, and locust and caterpillar came, of which there was no number,
And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured all the fruit of their ground.
And he smote all the firstborn in their land; the first fruits of all their toil.
He led them out also with silver and gold, and there was none weak among their tribes.
Egypt was glad when they departed, for fear of them fell upon them.
He spread a cloud for their shelter, and fire to give them light by night.
They asked, and there came quail, and with the bread of heaven he filled them.
He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; rivers ran in waterless places.
For he remembered his holy word, that to Abraham his servant.
And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen ones with gladness.
And gave them the lands of the heathen, and they inherited the labour of the people.
That they might keep his statutes, and seek after his law.
