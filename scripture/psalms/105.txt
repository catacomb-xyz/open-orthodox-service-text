O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for unto the age is his mercy.
Who shall speak of the mighty acts of the Lord? Who shall make all his praises to be heard?
Blessed are they that keep judgment, and do righteousness at all times.
Remember us, O Lord, in the good pleasure of thy people; visit us with thy salvation.
That we may see the goodness of thy chosen, to rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, to praise with thine inheritance.
We have sinned with our fathers; we have committed iniquity; we have wrought unrighteousness.
Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercy, and provoked thee going up by the Red Sea.
And yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his power known.
He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up, and he led them through the deep, as through a wilderness
And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of enemies.
Water covered those afflicting them; not one of them left remaining.
Then they believed in his word, and they sang his praise.
With haste they forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel,
And desired after desire in the wilderness, and tempted God in a waterless place.
So he gave them their request, and sent repletion unto their souls.
And they angered Moses in the camp, and Aaron the holy one of the Lord.
The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the congregation of Abiram.
And a fire was kindled in their congregation; a flame burned up sinners.
They also made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the graven image.
And they changed His glory into the likeness of a calf that eateth grass.
And they forgot God their Saviour, who had done great things in Egypt,
Wondrous works in the land of Ham, terrible things by the Red Sea.
Therefore he spake to utterly destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
And they held in contempt a desirable land; they believed not his word,
And murmured in their tents; they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.
Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to cast them down them in the wilderness,
And to cast down their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate sacrifices of the dead.
And they provoked him in their pursuits, and the calamity was multiplied among them.
Then Phineas stood up and made atonement, and made the destruction to cease.
And it was counted unto him for righteousness, unto generation and generation until the age.
And they provoked him to anger at a water of strife, so Moses was hurt for their sakes,
For they provoked his spirit, and he divided with his lips.
They did not destroy the nations, which their Lord told them,
But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
And they served their graven images, and it became a stumblingblock unto them.
Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto the demons,
And shed innocent blood, blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the graven images of Canaan, and the land was murdered with blood,
And it was defiled in their works, and they played the whore in their own pursuits.
Therefore with anger was the Lord wroth against his people, and he abhorred his own inheritance.
And he gave them into the hands of the heathen, and they that hated them ruled over them.
Their enemies also afflicted them, and they were humbled under their hands.
Many times did he deliver them, but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquities.
Yet the Lord saw them in their affliction, when he heard their supplication,
And he remembered his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercy.
And he gave them over to be pitied before all who carried them captive.
Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may confess thy holy Name, that we may glory in thy praise.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, from the age and until the age, and all the people shall say, So be it. So be it.
