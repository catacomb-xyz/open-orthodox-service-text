Deliver me from mine enemies, O God, and redeem me from them that rise up against me.
Deliver me from them that work iniquity, and from men of bloodshed, save me.
For behold, they have hunted my soul, mighty ones have set themselves against me; neither for my trangression, nor for my sin, O Lord.
Without trangression I ran, and kept straight; arise to meet me, and see.
And thou, O Lord God of powers, the God of Israel, draw near to visit all the nations; be not compassionate unto them that work iniquity.
They shall return at evening, and hunger like dogs, and go round about a city.
Behold, they shall speak out with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips; for who hath heard?
But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh them to scorn; thou shalt have all the nations in derision.
O my strength, I shall keep watch for thee, for thou, O God, art my support.
My God, his mercy shall come before me; my God will show to me among mine enemies.
Slay them not, lest they forget thy law; scatter them by thy power, and bring them down, O Lord my shield,
For a sin of their mouth, a word of their lips, and let them be caught in their pride, and from their curse and falsehood shall they be made known in consummation.
In wrath of consummation they shall be no more, and they shall know that God hath dominion over Jacob and the ends of the earth.
They shall return at evening, and hunger like dogs, and go round about a city.
They shall be scattered abroad to eat; they shall murmur if they be not filled.
But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will rejoice in the morning of thy mercy, for thou art become my support and my refuge in a time of mine affliction.
Thou art my helper, unto thee will I sing, for thou, O God, art my support; my God, my mercy.
