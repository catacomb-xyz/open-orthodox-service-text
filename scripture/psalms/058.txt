Deliver me from mine enemies, O God, and from them that rise up against me, redeem me.
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and from bloodthirsty men, save me.
For lo, they have hunted my soul, the mighty have set themselves against me; not for my trangression, nor for my sin, O Lord.
Without trangression I ran, and directed my steps; arise to meet me, and behold.
Thou therefore, O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, draw near to visit all the nations; be not compassionate unto them that work iniquity.
They shall return at evening, and hunger like dogs, and go round about the city.
Behold, they shall speak out with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips; for who, say they, hath heard?
But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh them to scorn; thou shalt bring all the nations to nought.
I will keep watch for thee, O my strength, for thou, O God, art my help.
My God, thy mercy shall go before me; my God shall reveal it unto me among mine enemies.
Do not ever slay them, lest they forget Thy law: scatter them by thy power, and bring them down, O Lord my defender,
For the sin of their mouth, and the word of their lips, let them even be taken in their pride, and from their curse and falsehood shall their destruction be made known in the end.
In the wrath of destruction, they shall be no more, and they shall know that God ruleth Jacob and the ends of the earth.
They shall return at evening, and hunger like dogs, and go round about the city.
They shall be scattered abroad to eat; they shall murmur if they be not filled.
But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will rejoice in the morning of thy mercy; for thou art become my help and my refuge in the day of mine affliction.
Thou art my helper, unto thee will I sing; for thou, O God, art my defender; my God, thou art my mercy.
