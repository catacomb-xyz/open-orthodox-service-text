We will confess Thee, O God, we will confess Thee, and we will call upon Thy Name. We will declare all Thy wondrous works.
When I am given the time of my reckoning, I will judge uprightly.
The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are wasted away; I have made strong the pillars thereof.
I said unto the transgressors: Transgress not; and to the sinners: Lift not up the horn.
Lift not up thy horn on high, and speak not unrighteousness against God.
For judgment cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the wilderness of the mountains: for God is judge.
He putteth down one, and raiseth up another; for in the hand of the Lord there is a cup full of unmingled wine.
And He hath turned it from side to side, but the dregs thereof were not emptied out; all the sinners of the earth shall drink of them.
But as for me, I will rejoice exceedingly for ever; I will sing praises unto the God of Jacob.
And I will break all the horns of the sinners, but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
