We shall confess thee, O God, we shall confess thee, and we shall call upon thy name.
I will tell of all thy wondrous works, whensoever I will take due time; I will judge with uprightness.
The earth is melted, and all they that dwell therein; I have made strong the pillars thereof.
I said unto transgressors, Do not transgress; and unto sinners, Lift not up a horn.
Lift not up your horn on high, and speak not unrighteousness against God.
For neither from goings out, nor from settings, nor from the wilderness of mountains
For God is judge; he putteth down one, and raiseth up another.
For a cup is in the hand of the Lord, unmixed wine full of mixture, and he hath turned it from side to side, but the dregs thereof were not emptied out; all the sinners of the earth shall drink.
But as for me, I will rejoice unto the age; I will sing praises unto the God of Jacob.
And all the horns of sinners will I crush together, but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
