We shall confess thee, O God, we shall confess thee, and we shall call upon thy name. We shall tell of all thy wondrous works.
Whensoever I shall take due time, I shall judge uprightly.
The earth is melted, and all they that dwell therein; I have made strong the pillars thereof.
I said unto the lawless: Work not lawlessness; and to the sinners: Lift not up the horn.
Lift not up your horn on high, and speak not unrighteousness against God.
For neither from the goings out, nor from the settings, nor from the wilderness of the mountains; for God is judge.
He putteth down one, and raiseth up another; for a cup is in the hand of the Lord, unmixed wine full of mixture,
And He hath turned it from side to side, but the dregs thereof were not emptied out; all the sinners of the earth shall drink.
But as for me, I will rejoice unto the age; I shall sing praises unto the God of Jacob.
And I shall break all the horns of sinners, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
