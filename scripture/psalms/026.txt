The Lord is my light and my saviour; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the defender of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
When the wicked drew nigh against me to eat up my flesh,
Even them that afflict me and are mine enemies, they were weakened, and fell.
Though a host should array itself against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise up against me, in this do I hope.
One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life; to behold the delight of the Lord, and to visit his holy temple.
For he hid me in his tabernacle in the day of my troubles, yea, he sheltered me in the secret place of his tabernacle; upon a rock he exalted me.
And now, behold, he hath exalted my head above mine enemies.
Therefore I went round about and offered in his tabernacle a sacrifice of praise and a shout of joy; I shall sing and chant unto the Lord.
Hear, O Lord, my voice, wherewith I have cried; have mercy on me and hear me.
My heart hath said unto thee: I shall seek out the Lord. My face hath sought thee; thy face, O Lord, shall I seek.
Turn not thy face away from me, and in anger turn not away from thy servant.
Become thou my help; cast me not away, neither forsake me, O God my saviour.
For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord hath taken me to himself.
Set a law upon me, O Lord, in thy way, and lead me in the right path, on account of mine enemies.
Deliver me not over to the souls of them that afflict me; for unjust witnesses are risen up against me, and injustice hath deceived itself.
I believe that I shall see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living.
Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and let thy heart be strengthened, and wait on the Lord.
