O God of my praise, be not thou silent,
For the mouth of the sinner and the mouth of the deceiver are opened against me; they have spoken against me with a deceitful tongue.
They compassed me about also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.
For my love they falsely accused me, but I gave myself unto prayer.
And they set against me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
Set thou a sinner upon him, and let a devil stand at his right hand.
When he is judged, let him go forth condemned, and let his prayer become sin.
Let his days be few, and let another take his office.
Let his sons be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
In being shaken, let his sons wander and beg; let them be cast out of their homes.
Let the creditor search out all his substance, and let the strangers spoil his labour.
Let there be none to support him, neither let there be any to pity his fatherless children.
Let his offspring be given over to utter destruction; in one generation let his name be blotted out.
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord, and let not the sin of his mother be wiped away.
Let them be before the Lord continually, and their remembrance be destroyed utterly from the earth.
Because that he remembered not to show mercy, but pursued unto death the man poor and needy, and the man broken in heart.
And he loved a curse, and it shall come unto him; as he delighted not in blessing, so shall it be far from him.
And he put on cursing like a garment, and it came like water into his entrails, and like oil into his bones.
Let it be unto him as a garment wherewith he is clothed, and like a girdle wherewith he girds himself at all times.
This is the dealing of the Lord with them that falsely accuse me, and with them that speak evils against my soul.
But thou Lord, O Lord, do unto me for the thy name's sake, for thy mercy is good.
Deliver me, for I am poor and needy, and my heart is troubled within me.
Like a shadow when it declineth am I taken away; I am shaken off as the locusts.
My knees are made weak through fasting, and my flesh is changed through oil.
I became also a reproach unto them; they looked upon me, and they shook their heads.
Help me, O Lord my God, and save me according to thy mercy,
And let them know that this is thy hand, and that thou, O Lord, hast done it.
They shall curse, but thou shalt bless; let them be put to shame that rise up against me, but thy servant shall be glad.
Let them that accuse me be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
I will greatly confess the Lord with my mouth; yea, in the midst of many will I praise him.
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save from them that pursue after my soul.
