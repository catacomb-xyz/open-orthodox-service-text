O God, why hast Thou cast us off for ever? Why hath thine anger raged against sheep of thy pasture?
Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; thou hast redeemed a rod of thine inheritance, this mount Sion wherein thou hast dwelt.
Lift up thy hands against their pride unto an end, as many as have done wickedly among thy saints.
And they that hate thee have made their boast in the midst of thy feast; they set up their ensigns for signs,
Though they knew it not, as though into the entrance above.
As though in a thicket of trees, with axes they cut down its doors altogether; with twoedged axe and mason's hammer have they broken it down.
They have set fire to thy sanctuary; they profaned to the ground the tabernacle of thy name.
They said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together, Come, let us abolish all the feasts of God from the earth.
We saw not our signs, there is no more a prophet, and he will know us no longer.
How long, O God, shall the enemy utter reproaches? Shall the adversary utterly provoke thy name?
Why dost thou turn away thy hand, even thy right hand, from the midst of thy bosom for ever?
But God is our king from before the ages; he hath wrought salvation in the midst of the earth.
Thou didst establish the sea by thy power; thou didst bruise the heads of the dragons upon the water.
Thou didst break the heads of the dragon in pieces; thou gavest him to be meat to the Ethiopian people.
Thou didst cleave fountains and floods; thou hast dried up rivers of Etham.
Thine is the day, and thine is the night; thou hast prepared light and sun.
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; thou hast fashioned summer and spring.
Remember this, that an enemy hath reproached the Lord, and a foolish people hath provoked thy name.
O deliver not over unto the wild beasts a soul that doth confess thee; forget not utterly the souls of thy needy.
Have respect unto thy covenant, for the darkened of the earth are filled with houses of iniquity.
Let not a humble man be turned away in shame; a poor and needy man shall praise thy name.
Arise, O God, judge thine own cause; remember the reproach of the fool all the day long.
Forget not the voice of thy suppliants; the pride of them that hate thee ascendeth for ever.
