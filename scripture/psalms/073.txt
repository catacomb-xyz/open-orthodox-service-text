O God, why hast Thou cast us off for ever? Why hath Thine anger raged against the sheep of Thy pasture?
Remember Thy congregation, which Thou hast purchased of old.
Thou hast redeemed the rod of Thine inheritance, this Mount Sion wherein Thou hast dwelt.
Lift up Thy hands against their perpetual pride, even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in Thy sanctuary.
And they that hate Thee have made their boast in the midst of Thy feast.
They set up their ensigns for signs, though they knew it not, as in the entrance above.
They have cut down at once the doors thereof with axes as in a forest of trees; they have broken it down with axe and hammer.
They have set fire to Thy sanctuary; they have profaned the dwelling place of Thy Name on the earth.
They said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together: Come, let us abolish all the feasts of God from the earth.
We have not seen our signs, there is no longer a prophet, and he will know us no more.
O God, how long shall the enemy utter reproaches? Shall the enemy provoke Thy Name for ever?
Why dost Thou withdraw Thy hand, even Thy right hand, out of the midst of Thy bosom for ever?
But God is our King of old; He hath wrought salvation in the midst of the earth.
Thou didst establish the sea by Thy strength; Thou didst break the heads of the dragons in the water.
Thou didst crush the head of the dragon; Thou gavest him as meat to the Ethiopian peoples.
Thou didst cleave the fountains and the floods, Thou hast dried up the rivers of Etham.
Thine is the day, and Thine is the night; Thou hast perfected the light and the sun.
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; Thou hast fashioned the summer and spring.
Remember this Thy creation, The enemy hath reproached the Lord, and a foolish people hath provoked Thy Name.
O deliver not over unto the wild beasts the soul that doth confess Thee; forget not the souls of Thy poor for ever.
Have respect unto Thy covenant, for the dark places of the earth are filled with the habitations of iniquity.
Let not the humble and ashamed be turned away; the poor and the needy shall praise Thy Name.
Arise, O God, judge Thine own cause; remember the reproach that is made against Thee daily by the foolish man.
Forget not the voice of Thy suppliants; let the pride of them that hate Thee ascend ever before Thee.
