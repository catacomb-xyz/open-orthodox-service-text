In thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me not be put to shame unto the age.
In thy righteousness, rescue me, and deliver me; incline thine ear unto me, and save me.
Be unto me a protecting God, and a strong hold to save me, for thou art my rock and my refuge.
Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the sinner, from the hand of the transgressor and unjust man.
For thou art my patience, O Lord; O Lord, thou art my hope from my youth.
Upon thee was I strengthened from the womb; from my mother's belly thou art my protector. In thee ever is my song of praise.
I am as a wonder unto many, and thou art my strong helper.
Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may hymn thy glory, all the day thy majesty.
Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.
For mine enemies spake against me, and they that watch for my soul took counsel together,
Saying: God hath forsaken him; pursue and take him, for there is none to deliver.
O God, be not far from me; O my God, give heed unto my help.
Let them be ashamed and fail that slander my soul; let them be covered with shame and confusion that seek my hurt.
But I shall hope in thee for ever, and I shall add to all thy praise.
My mouth shall proclaim thy righteousness, all the day long thy salvation; for I know not the reckoning thereof.
I shall go in the strength of the Lord; O Lord, I shall remember thy righteousness, which is thine alone.
O God, thou hast taught me from my youth, even as yet shall I show thy wonders.
Yea, even unto old age and honoured years, O God, forsake me not, until I should show forth thine arm unto every generation to come,
Thy power and thy righteousness, O God, as far as the highest, the great works which thou hast done for me. O God, who is like unto thee?
How many are the afflictions and evils which thou hast shown me; yet having turned about, thou hast quickened me, and hast brought me up again from the depths of the earth.
Thou hast multiplied thy magnificence over me, and having turned about, thou hast comforted me, and hast brought me up again out from depths of the earth.
Therefore shall I confess thee among the people, O Lord, thy truth with instruments of psalmody; I shall sing unto thee with the harp, O God, thou Holy One of Israel.
My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee, yea, even my soul which thou hast redeemed.
Moreover my tongue shall meditate on thy righteousness all the day long, when they be put to shame and confounded that seek evils for me.
