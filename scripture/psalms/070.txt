In thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me not be put to shame unto the age.
In thy righteousness, rescue me, and deliver me; incline thine ear unto me, and save me.
Be unto me a protecting God, and a strong hold to save me, for thou art my rock and my refuge.
Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of a sinner, from the hand of a transgressor and unjust man.
For thou art my patience, O Lord; O Lord, thou art my hope from my youth.
By thee have I been strengthened from birth; from my mother's belly thou art my shelter; my song of praise is continually of thee.
I am as as a wonder unto many, and thou art my strong helper.
Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may hymn to thy glory, all the day to thy majesty.
Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.
For mine enemies spake against me, and they that watch for my soul took counsel together,
Saying, God hath forsaken him; pursue and take him, for there is none to deliver.
O God, be not far from me; O my God, give heed unto my help.
Let them be ashamed and fail that slander my soul; let them be covered with shame and confusion that seek my hurt.
But I will hope in thee for ever, and I will add to all thy praise.
My mouth shall proclaim thy righteousness, all the day long thy salvation; for I know not the reckoning thereof.
I will go in the strength of the Lord; O Lord, I will remember thy righteousness, which is thine alone.
O God, thou hast taught me from my youth, even as yet will I declare thy wonders.
Yea, even unto old age and honoured years, O God, forsake me not, until I should show forth thine arm unto every generation to come,
Thy power and thy righteousness, O God, as far as the highest, what great works which thou hast done for me. O God, who is like unto thee?
Whatsoever thou hast shown me, many afflictions and evil things, yet having turned about, thou hast quickened me, and hast brought me up again from the depths of the earth.
Thou hast multiplied thy magnificence over me, and having turned about, thou hast comforted me, and hast brought me up again out from depths of the earth.
Therefore will I confess thee among peoples, O Lord, thy truth with an instrument of psalmody; I will sing unto thee with a harp, O God, thou Holy One of Israel.
My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee, yea, even my soul which thou hast redeemed.
Moreover my tongue shall meditate on thy righteousness all the day long, when they be put to shame and confounded that seek evils for me.
