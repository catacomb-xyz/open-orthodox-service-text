O Lord, hear my prayer, give ear unto my supplication in thy truth; hearken unto me in thy righteousness,
And enter not into judgment with thy servant; for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
For the enemy hath pursued after my soul; he hath humbled my life down to the earth. He hath sat me in darkness as those that have been long dead,
And my spirit hath fainted within me; within me my heart is troubled.
I remembered days of old; I meditated on all thy works; I meditated on things made of thy hands.
I stretched forth my hands unto thee; my soul thirsteth after thee like a waterless land.
Hear me speedily, O Lord; my spirit hath fainted away. Turn not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into a pit.
Cause me to hear thy mercy in the morning, for in thee have I put my hope; cause me to know, O Lord, a way wherein I should walk, for unto thee have I lifted up my soul.
Deliver me from mine enemies, O Lord; unto thee have I fled for refuge.
Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God; thy good Spirit shall lead me into a land of uprightness.
Quicken me, O Lord, for thy nameâ€™s sake; in thy righteousness shalt thou bring my soul out of affliction.
And in thy mercy shalt thou utterly destroy mine enemies, and thou shalt bring to ruin all them that afflict my soul, for I am thy servant.
