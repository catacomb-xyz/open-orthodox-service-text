O Lord, hear my prayer, give ear unto my supplication in thy truth; hear me in thy righteousness.
And enter not into judgment with thy servant; for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
For the enemy hath closely followed my soul; he hath humbled my life down to the earth.
He hath sat me in darkness as those that have been long dead, and my spirit hath fainted within me; within me my heart is troubled.
I remembered the days of old; I meditated on all thy works; I meditated on the creations of thy hands.
I stretched forth my hands unto thee; my soul thirsteth after thee like a waterless land.
Quickly hear me, O Lord; my spirit hath fainted away.
Turn not Thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
Cause me to hear thy mercy in the morning, for in thee have I put my hope.
Cause me to know, O Lord, the way wherein I should walk, for unto thee have I lifted up my soul.
Deliver me from mine enemies, O Lord; unto thee have I fled for refuge. Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God.
Thy good Spirit shall lead me into the land of uprightness; for thy nameâ€™s sake, O Lord, shalt thou make me to live.
In thy righteousness shalt thou bring my soul out of affliction, and in thy mercy shalt thou utterly destroy mine enemies.
And thou shalt bring to ruin all them that press hard upon my soul, for I am thy servant.
