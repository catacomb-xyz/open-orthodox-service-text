O Lord, in thy power the king shall be glad, and in thy salvation shall he greatly rejoice.
The desires of his heart thou didst grant unto him, and the requests of his lips thou hast not withheld .
For Thou hast come before him with the blessings of goodness; thou hast set a crown of precious stone upon his head.
He asked for himself life of thee, and thou gavest him length of days unto age of age.
Great is his glory in thy salvation; glory and majesty shalt thou lay upon him.
For Thou shalt give him blessing unto age of age; thou shalt make him joyful in gladness with thy countenance.
For the king hopeth in the Lord, and in the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved.
Let Thy hand be found by all thine enemies; let thy right hand find out all those that hate Thee.
For thou shalt make them as an oven of fire in the time of thy presence; the Lord in his wrath shall confound them, and the fire shall devour them.
Their fruit wilt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from the sons of men.
For they have inclined evils against thee; they have devised councils which they shall not be able to make stand.
For Thou shalt make them turn their back; in thy remnant, thou shalt prepare their face.
Be thou lifted up, O Lord, in thy power; we will sing and praise thy mighty acts.
