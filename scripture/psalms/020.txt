The king shall be glad in Thy strength, O Lord, and in Thy salvation greatly shall he rejoice.
Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withheld the requests of his lips.
For Thou hast gone before him with the blessings of goodness; Thou hast set a crown of precious stone upon his head.
He asked life of Thee, and Thou gavest him length of days unto ages of ages.
His glory is great in Thy salvation; glory and majesty shalt Thou lay upon him.
For Thou shalt give him blessing for ever and ever; Thou shalt make him exceedingly glad with Thy countenance.
For the king hopeth in the Lord, and through the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved.
Let Thy hand be found on all Thine enemies; let Thy right hand find out all those that hate Thee.
For Thou shalt make them as an oven of fire in the time of Thy presence; the Lord shall trouble them in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them.
Their fruit shalt Thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
For they intended evils against Thee; they have devised councils which they shall not be able to make stand.
For Thou shalt make them turn their back; among them that are Thy remnant, Thou shalt prepare their face.
Be Thou exalted, O Lord, in Thy strength; we will sing and praise of Thy mighty acts.
