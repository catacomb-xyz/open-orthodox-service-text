O Lord, in thy power the king shall be glad, and in thy salvation shall he greatly rejoice.
The desires of his heart hast thou given him, and the requests of his lips hast thou not withheld .
For thou hast come before him with the blessings of goodness; thou hast set a crown of precious stone upon his head.
He asked for himself life of thee, and thou gavest him length of days, unto the age of age.
Great is his glory in thy salvation; glory and majesty shalt thou lay upon him.
For thou shalt give him blessing unto the age of age; with thy face thou shalt make him joyful in gladness.
For the king hopeth in the Lord, and in the mercy of the most high he shall not be moved.
Let thy hand be found by all thine enemies; let thy right hand find out all those that hate thee.
For thou shalt make them as an oven of fire in the time of thy presence; the Lord in his wrath shall confound them, and they shall be swallowed up in fire.
Their fruit wilt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from the sons of men.
For they have inclined evils against thee; they have devised councils which shall not be made to stand.
For thou shalt make them turn their back; in thy remnant, thou shalt prepare their face.
Be thou exalted, O Lord, in thy power; we shall sing and chant of thy mighty acts.
