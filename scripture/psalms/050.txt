Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of Thy compassions blot out my transgression.
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my transgression, and my sin is ever before me.
Against Thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in Thy sight; that Thou mightest be justified in Thy sayings, and overcome when Thou art judged.
For behold, I was conceived in iniquity, and in sins did my mother bear me.
For behold, Thou hast loved truth; the hidden and secret things of Thy wisdom hast Thou made manifest unto me.
Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be made clean; Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.
Thou shalt make me to hear joy and gladness; the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.
Turn Thy face away from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and establish me with Thy governing Spirit.
Then I shall teach transgressors Thy ways, and the ungodly shall turn again unto Thee.
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation; my tongue shall rejoice in Thy righteousness.
O Lord, Thou shalt open my lips, and my mouth shall show forth Thy praise.
For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would have given it, with whole burnt offerings Thou shalt not be pleased.
A sacrifice unto God is a broken spirit; a broken and humbled heart God will not despise.
Do good, O Lord, in Thy good pleasure unto Sion, and let the walls of Jerusalem be builded.
Then shalt Thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, with oblation and whole burnt offerings.
Then shall they offer bullocks upon Thine altar.
