In mine affliction I cried unto the Lord, and He heard me.
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from unjust lips and from a deceitful tongue.
What shall be given unto thee, or what shall be added unto thee, for a deceitful tongue?
The arrows of the mighty, sharpened together with the coals of desolation.
Woe is me, that my sojourn is prolonged, that I encamped among the tents of Kedar; long has my soul been as a stranger.
With them that hated peace was I peaceable; when I spake unto them, they made war against me without a cause.
