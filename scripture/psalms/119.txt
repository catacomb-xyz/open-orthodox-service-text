Unto the Lord I cried out in mine affliction, and he did hear me.
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from unjust lips and from a deceitful tongue.
What shall be given unto thee, or what shall be added unto thee, from a deceitful tongue?
The arrows of the mighty, sharpened together with the coals of desolation.
Woe is me, that my sojourning is prolonged. I encamped among the tents of Kedar; long hath my soul been a stranger.
With them that hated peace was I peaceable; when I spake unto them, they warred against me without a cause.
