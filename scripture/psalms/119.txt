In mine affliction I cried unto the Lord, and He heard me.
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from unjust lips and from a deceitful tongue.
What shall be given unto thee, or what shall be added unto thee, for a deceitful tongue?
The sharp arrows of the mighty One, together with the coals of desolation.
Woe is me, that my sojourn is prolonged. I have encamped among the tents of Kedar; long as a foreigner did my soul live.
With them that hated peace was I peaceable; when I spake to them, they made war against me without a cause.
