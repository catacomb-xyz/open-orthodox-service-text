Blessed is he that considereth those poor and needy; on an evil day the Lord will deliver him.
May the Lord preserve him, and give him life, and make him blessed upon the earth, and deliver him not unto the hands of his enemy.
May the Lord help him upon the bed of his pain; thou hast turned about his whole bed in his sickness.
I said, O Lord, have mercy on me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.
Mine enemies have spoken evils against me, saying, When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he came to see me, his heart spake vanity; he gathered iniquity unto himself; he went forth, and spake in like manner.
Against me all mine enemies whispered; against me they devised evils for me.
They set down a wicked word against me, saying, Shall he that sleepeth rise up again?
Yea, even the man of my peace, in whom I hoped, who did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.
But thou, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up, and I will repay them.
By this I know that thou hast delighted in me, that mine enemy shall not rejoice over me.
But thou didst help me on account of mine innocence, and didst established me before thy face unto the age.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from the age, and unto the age. So be it. So be it.
