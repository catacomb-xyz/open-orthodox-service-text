Blessed is he that considereth the poor and needy; the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble.
May the Lord preserve him, and give him life, and make him blessed upon the earth, and deliver him not unto the hands of his enemies.
May the Lord help him upon his bed of pain; Thou hast turned about his whole bed to the better in his sickness.
I said: O Lord, be merciful unto me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee.
Mine enemies have spoken evils against me, saying: When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he came to see me, his heart spake vanity; he gathered iniquity to himself; he went forth, and spake in like manner.
All they that hate me whispered together against me; they devised evils against me.
They set down a wicked word against me, saying: Shall he that sleepeth rise up again?
Yea, even my own familiar friend, in whom I hoped, who did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.
But Thou, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up, and I will repay them.
By this I know that Thou hast delighted in me, because mine enemy doth not rejoice over me.
But Thou didst help me on account of mine innocence, and didst established me before Thy face for ever.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. So be it. So be it.
