God have compassion on us and bless us, and cause his face to shine upon us, and have mercy on us.
That we may know thy way upon earth; thy salvation among all nations.
Let the peoples confess Thee, O God, let all the peoples confess thee.
O let the nations be glad and rejoice, for thou shalt judge the people with uprightness, and guide the nations upon earth.
Let the peoples confess thee, O God, let all the peoples confess thee.
The earth hath yielded her fruit; let God, our God, bless us;
Let God bless us, and let all the ends of the earth fear Him.
