God be compassionate unto us and bless us, and cause His face to shine upon us, and have mercy on us.
That we may know Thy way upon earth; Thy salvation among all nations.
Let the peoples give praise unto Thee, O God, let all the peoples give praise unto Thee.
O let the nations be glad and rejoice, for Thou shalt judge the people with uprightness, and guide the nations upon earth.
Let the peoples give praise unto Thee, O God, let all the peoples give praise unto Thee.
The earth hath yielded her fruit; let God, our God, bless us;
Let God bless us, and let all the ends of the earth fear Him.
