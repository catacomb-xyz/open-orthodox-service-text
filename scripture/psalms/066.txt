May God have compassion on us, and bless us, and cause his face to shine upon us, and have mercy on us.
That we may know thy way upon earth; thy salvation among all nations.
Let peoples confess unto thee, O God, let all peoples confess unto thee.
Let nations be glad and rejoice, for thou shalt judge peoples with uprightness, and guide nations upon earth.
Let peoples confess unto thee, O God, let all peoples confess unto thee.
Earth hath yielded her fruit; may God, our God, bless us.
May God bless us, and let all the ends of the earth be fearful unto him.
