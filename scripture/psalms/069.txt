O God, give heed unto my help. O Lord, make haste to help me.
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul. Let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, them that desire evils against me.
Let them at once be turned back in shame that say to me, Well done, well done!
Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee, O God, and let them that love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified.
But as for me, I am poor and needy; help me, O God. My helper and deliverer art thou, O Lord; make no long tarrying.
