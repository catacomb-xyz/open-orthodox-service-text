He that dwelleth in the help of the most high shall abide under the shelter of the God of heaven.
He shall say unto the Lord, Thou art my shield and my refuge; he is my God, and I shall hope in him.
For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunters, and from every troubling word.
With his shoulders shall he overshadow thee, and under his wings shalt thou hope; with a shield shall his truth surround thee.
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the thing that walketh in darkness, nor for the mishap and the demon of noonday.
A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand, but it shall not come nigh unto thee.
Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the reward of the sinners.
For thou, O Lord, art my hope; thou hast made the most high thy refuge.
No evils shall come nigh thee, and no scourge shall come nigh unto thy dwelling.
For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
On their hands shall they bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Upon the asp and basilisk shalt thou tread, and thou shalt trample under foot the lion and dragon.
For he hath set his hope in me, and I will deliver him; I will shelter him because he hath known my name.
He shall cry unto me, and I will hear him; I am with him in affliction, and I will deliver him and glorify him.
With length of days will I satisfy him, and I will show him my salvation.
