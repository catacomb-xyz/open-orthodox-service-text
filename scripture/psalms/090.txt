He that dwelleth in the help of the Most High shall abide under the shelter of the God of heaven.
He shall say unto the Lord: Thou art my helper and my refuge. He is my God, and in I will hope in Him.
For He shall deliver thee from the snare of the hunters, and from every troubling word.
With His shoulders shall He overshadow thee, and under His wings shalt thou hope; His truth shall cover thee with a shield.
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the thing that walketh in darkness, nor for the mishap and the demon of noonday.
A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh unto thee.
Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the reward of the sinners.
For Thou, O Lord, art my hope. Thou hast made the Most High thy refuge.
There shall no evils come upon thee, neither shall any plague come nigh unto thy dwelling.
For He shall give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
On their hands shall they bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Thou shalt tread upon the asp and basilisk, and upon the lion and the dragon shalt thou trample underfoot.
For he hath set his hope in Me, and I will deliver him; I will shelter him because he hath known My Name.
He shall cry unto Me, and I will hearken unto him; I am with him in affliction, and I will deliver him and glorify him.
With length of days will I satisfy him, and I will show him My salvation.
