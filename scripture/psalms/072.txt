How good is God to Israel, to those upright in heart.
But as for me, my feet were almost moved; well nigh stumbling in my steps.
For I was envious of the lawless, as I beheld the peace of sinners.
For they make no refusal in their death, nor steadfastness in their scourging.
They are not in toils as of other men, and with men they shall not be scourged.
Therefore pride hath seized them; they have clothed themselves with injustice and ungodliness.
Their injustice shall go forth as out of fatness; they passed through in the disposition of their heart.
They thought and spake in wickedness; they spake unrighteously against the highest.
They set for themselves their mouth against heaven, and their tongue went abroad upon the earth.
Therefore shall my people return hither, and full days shall be found among them.
And they said, How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the most High?
Behold, these are the sinners, and yet they prosper, unto the age they hold fast to wealth.
And I said, Verily, in vain have I justified my heart, and washed my hands in innocence.
And I became scourged all the day long, and reproof was mine every morning.
If I were to say, Thus shall I recount this, behold, I would have broken covenant with the generation of thy sons.
And I sought to know this; it was a labour before me,
Until I went into the sanctuary of God, and understood their latter end.
But indeed for their deceits thou appointed evils unto them; thou cast them down when they were lifted up.
How they came unto desolation! Suddenly they failed; they have perished by reason of their iniquity.
As a dream of one who awaketh, O Lord, in thy city shalt thou bring their image to nought.
For my heart was kindled and my reins were changed.
I was reckoned as nothing, and I knew it not. I became as a beast before thee, yet I am ever with thee.
Thou hast holden me by my right hand; in thy counsel thou hast guided me, and hast received me with glory.
For what have I in heaven? And besides thee what have I desired upon the earth?
My heart and my flesh have failed; O God of my heart, and my portion, O God, unto the age.
For behold, they that keep themselves afar from thee shall perish; thou hast utterly destroyed all them that played the whore against thee.
But it is good for me to cleave unto God, to put my hope in the Lord, that I may show forth all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
