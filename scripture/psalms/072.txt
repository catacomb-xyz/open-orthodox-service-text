How good is God to Israel, to those upright in heart.
But as for me, my feet were almost moved; well nigh stumbling in my steps.
For I did envy the lawless, and I saw the peace of sinners.
For they make no refusal in their death, and are steadfast in their scourging.
They are not in toils as of other men, nor with men shall they be scourged.
For this their pride hath mastered them; they clothed themselves with injustice and ungodliness.
Their injustice shall go forth as out of fatness; they passed through to their heartâ€™s desire.
They thought and spake in wickedness; they spake unrighteously against the heights.
They set for themselves their mouth against heaven, and their tongue went abroad upon the earth.
Therefore shall my people return hither, and full days shall be found in them.
And they said: How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?
Behold, these are the sinners; they prosper to the age and seize wealth.
And I said: Verily, in vain have I justified my heart, and washed my hands in innocence.
And I became a man scourged all the day long, and reproof was mine every morning.
If I were to say: Thus shall I recount this, behold, I would have broken covenant with the generation of thy sons.
And I sought to know this, but it was a labour before me.
Until I went into the sanctuary of God, and understood their latter end.
But on account of their deceits thou appointed evils unto them; thou cast them down when they were lifted up.
How they come unto desolation! Suddenly they failed; they have perished on account of their lawlessness.
As a dream of one who awaketh, O Lord, in thy city shalt thou bring their image to nought.
For my heart was kindled and my reins were changed.
I myself was brought to nothing, and I knew it not. I became as a beast before thee, yet I am ever with thee.
Thou hast holden me by my right hand; in thy counsel thou hast guided me, and hast received me with glory.
For what have I in heaven? And besides thee, what have I desired upon the earth?
My heart and my flesh have failed; O God of my heart, and my portion, O God, unto the age.
For behold, they that keep themselves afar from thee shall perish; thou hast utterly destroyed all them that played the whore against thee.
But it is good for me to cleave unto God, to put my hope in the Lord, that I may show forth all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
